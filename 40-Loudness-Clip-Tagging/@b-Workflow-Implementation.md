# @b-Workflow-Implementation - Practical Audio Editing and Loudness Control Workflows

## üéØ Learning Objectives
- Implement efficient loudness normalization workflows for different content types
- Master DaVinci Resolve's Fairlight audio tools for professional loudness control
- Create consistent tagging workflows that scale across large audio libraries
- Optimize audio processing pipelines for speed and quality

## üîß DaVinci Resolve Fairlight Workflow

### Initial Project Setup
```yaml
Project Configuration:
  Timeline Settings:
    - Sample Rate: 48kHz (broadcast standard)
    - Bit Depth: 24-bit minimum
    - Frame Rate: Match video project requirements
  
  Audio Monitoring:
    - Enable Loudness Meter: Fairlight > View > Loudness Meter
    - Set Target Standard: EBU R128 (-23 LUFS) or streaming (-14 LUFS)
    - Configure True Peak limiting: -1 dBTP
    - Enable Loudness History for session tracking
```

### Loudness Analysis Workflow
```yaml
Step 1 - Import and Initial Assessment:
  - Import audio files to Media Pool
  - Drag to timeline on dedicated audio tracks
  - Enable Loudness Meter (floating window recommended)
  - Play full timeline to capture Integrated LUFS measurement

Step 2 - Loudness Adjustment:
  - Select all audio clips needing adjustment
  - Right-click > Normalize Audio Levels
  - Choose "Loudness" instead of "Peak"
  - Set target LUFS value (-14 for streaming, -23 for broadcast)
  - Apply and verify with Loudness Meter

Step 3 - Fine-Tuning:
  - Use Track Level automation for dynamic content
  - Apply gentle compression if needed (2:1 ratio maximum)
  - Set final limiter: -1 dBTP ceiling, fast attack, medium release
  - Final verification playthrough with continuous monitoring
```

### Batch Processing in Fairlight
```yaml
Multi-Clip Workflow:
  1. Select multiple clips in timeline
  2. Inspector > Audio > Normalize Audio Levels
  3. Choose "Loudness" normalization method
  4. Set consistent target LUFS across all clips
  5. Render individual clips or full timeline

Export Settings:
  - Format: WAV (uncompressed) or FLAC (lossless compressed)
  - Sample Rate: 48kHz (maintain project rate)
  - Bit Depth: 24-bit for archival, 16-bit for final delivery
  - Channels: Match source (mono, stereo, surround)
```

## üìÅ File Organization and Tagging System

### Directory Structure Implementation
```yaml
Master Library Structure:
/Audio_Projects/
  /00_Raw_Imports/
    - Original files with embedded metadata
    - Preserve original filenames for reference
  
  /01_Processed/
    /Music/
      /Upbeat_Commercial/
      /Ambient_Background/
      /Cinematic_Score/
    /SFX/
      /UI_Elements/
      /Transitions/
      /Impact_Sounds/
    /Voice/
      /Narration/
      /Character/
  
  /02_Delivered/
    /Platform_Optimized/
      /YouTube_-14LUFS/
      /Broadcast_-23LUFS/
      /Podcast_-16LUFS/
```

### Metadata Embedding Workflow
```yaml
File Naming Convention:
  Format: "{Category}_{Subcategory}_{Mood}_{Duration}_{LUFS}_{ID}.wav"
  Examples:
    - "Music_Commercial_Upbeat_0230_-14.2LUFS_MC001.wav"
    - "SFX_UI_Click_0001_-18.5LUFS_SF045.wav"
    - "Voice_Narration_Professional_1245_-20.1LUFS_VN012.wav"

Embedded Metadata Fields:
  - Title: Descriptive name for content
  - Artist: Creator or source attribution
  - Album: Project or collection name
  - Genre: Primary category (Music/SFX/Voice)
  - Comment: Technical specs and usage notes
  - Track Number: Unique identifier within collection
```

### Tagging Implementation Process
```yaml
Pre-Processing Tags:
  1. Import original file
  2. Analyze content (genre, mood, instrumentation)
  3. Measure technical specs (duration, sample rate, bit depth)
  4. Add initial metadata before processing

Post-Processing Tags:
  1. Measure final LUFS value
  2. Calculate dynamic range (LRA)
  3. Verify true peak compliance
  4. Update metadata with processed specifications
  5. Add quality assurance notes
```

## ‚ö° Automated Batch Processing Workflows

### Command Line Tools Integration
```bash
# FFmpeg Loudness Analysis and Normalization
ffmpeg -i input.wav -af loudnorm=I=-14:TP=-1:LRA=7:print_format=json -f null -

# Batch LUFS measurement script
for file in *.wav; do
  ffmpeg -i "$file" -af loudnorm=print_format=json -f null - 2>&1 | grep "input_i" >> lufs_report.txt
done

# Automated file renaming with LUFS values
python batch_rename_with_lufs.py --input_folder /path/to/audio --target_lufs -14
```

### Spreadsheet Tracking System
```yaml
Audio Library Database (Excel/Google Sheets):
  Columns:
    - File_ID: Unique identifier
    - Original_Filename: Source file reference
    - Processed_Filename: Final tagged filename
    - Category: Music/SFX/Voice
    - Subcategory: Detailed classification
    - Duration_Seconds: Exact length
    - LUFS_Integrated: Measured loudness
    - Peak_dBFS: Maximum sample peak
    - True_Peak_dBTP: Inter-sample peak measurement
    - Dynamic_Range_LRA: Loudness range value
    - Date_Processed: Quality control timestamp
    - Platform_Compliance: Streaming/Broadcast/Podcast
    - Usage_Notes: Special instructions or restrictions
```

## üéõÔ∏è Platform-Specific Optimization Workflows

### YouTube Content Preparation
```yaml
Target Specifications:
  - Integrated LUFS: -14 LUFS
  - True Peak Limit: -1 dBTP
  - Dynamic Range: Preserve natural dynamics (avoid over-compression)

Processing Workflow:
  1. Import to DaVinci Resolve timeline
  2. Set Loudness Meter to -14 LUFS target
  3. Apply loudness normalization to -14 LUFS
  4. Add subtle limiting for peak control (-1 dBTP ceiling)
  5. Export as 48kHz/24-bit WAV
  6. Final verification with external loudness meter
```

### Podcast Distribution Workflow
```yaml
Multi-Platform Targets:
  - Apple Podcasts: -16 LUFS recommended
  - Spotify: -14 LUFS (music normalization applied)
  - Google Podcasts: -16 LUFS
  - Generic Distribution: -16 LUFS (safe middle ground)

Processing Steps:
  1. Record or import source audio at -20 dBFS peaks
  2. Apply noise reduction and EQ corrections
  3. Normalize dialogue to -16 LUFS integrated
  4. Apply gentle compression (3:1 ratio, slow attack)
  5. Final limiting at -1 dBTP
  6. Export multiple versions for different platforms
```

### Broadcast Delivery Standards
```yaml
EBU R128 Compliance Workflow:
  Target: -23 LUFS ¬±1 LU tolerance
  True Peak: -1 dBTP maximum
  Loudness Range: No specific limit (preserve natural dynamics)

Quality Control Process:
  1. Full program loudness measurement
  2. Segment-by-segment analysis for consistency
  3. Gate threshold verification (-10 LUFS relative)
  4. True peak analysis with 4x oversampling
  5. Delivery with comprehensive loudness report
```
