- Implement logical category hierarchies (Projects > Year > Client)
- Create template folder structures for recurring project types
- Maintain parallel structures across different platforms

**Universal Naming Conventions**
- Date formats: YYYY-MM-DD for chronological sorting
- Project codes: Consistent abbreviations for quick identification
- Version control: v01, v02 for document iterations
- Status indicators: DRAFT, FINAL, ARCHIVE prefixes

**Access and Sync Strategy**
- Cloud storage for universal access and backup
- Local copies for high-performance work
- Automated sync verification and conflict resolution
- Offline access planning for critical files

### Digital Note-Taking Systems
**Progressive Summarization Method**
- **Layer 1**: Original content capture
- **Layer 2**: Bold key passages during review
- **Layer 3**: Highlight critical insights
- **Layer 4**: Executive summary and personal commentary

**Zettelkasten (Linked Knowledge)**
- Atomic notes with single concepts
- Unique identifiers for each note
- Extensive cross-linking between related ideas
- Emergent structure through connections

**PARA Method (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive)**
- **Projects**: Specific outcomes with deadlines
- **Areas**: Ongoing responsibilities to maintain
- **Resources**: Topics of ongoing interest
- **Archive**: Inactive items from other categories

### Information Capture Workflows
**Inbox Processing**
- Single universal inbox for all digital inputs
- Regular processing schedule (daily/weekly)
- Quick decision framework: Do, Defer, Delegate, Delete
- Automated routing based on content type and source

**Content Curation**
- RSS feeds and newsletter management
- Web clipping tools for research and reference
- Social media content organization
- Bookmark management with tagging systems

## ðŸš€ AI/LLM Integration Opportunities

### Automated Organization
```
"Analyze this folder structure [description] and suggest improvements for better organization and faster file retrieval"
```

### Content Processing
```
"Summarize this document collection [files/notes] and create a structured knowledge base with key themes and connections"
```

### Workflow Automation
```
"Design an automated workflow for processing [type of digital content] from capture to final organization and retrieval"
```

### Knowledge Management
```
"Help me create a personal knowledge management system that connects notes from [source types] and enables easy retrieval and synthesis"
```
