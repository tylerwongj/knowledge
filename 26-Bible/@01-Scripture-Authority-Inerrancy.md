## üìñ Reformed Doctrine of Scripture

### Sola Scriptura - Scripture Alone
**Definition**: Scripture is the only infallible rule of faith and practice

**R.C. Sproul**: "The Bible is not man's word about God, but God's word about man. It is the supreme and final authority for all doctrine and life."

**Key Principles**:
- **Self-authenticating**: Scripture proves its own authority
- **Scripture interprets Scripture**: Clear passages explain difficult ones
- **Final authority**: Church tradition and experience submit to Scripture
- **Sufficient**: Contains all necessary truth for salvation and godliness

**Biblical Foundation**:
- **2 Timothy 3:16-17**: "All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness"
- **Isaiah 8:20**: "To the teaching and to the testimony! If they will not speak according to this word, it is because they have no dawn"

### Verbal Plenary Inspiration
**John MacArthur**: "Every word of Scripture in the original manuscripts was inspired by God. This means that the very words, not just the thoughts or concepts, are God-breathed."

**Key Components**:
- **Verbal**: The very words were inspired, not just concepts
- **Plenary**: All of Scripture is equally inspired
- **Original autographs**: Inerrancy applies to original manuscripts
- **Divine-human authorship**: God used human authors without error

**Biblical Support**:
- **2 Peter 1:20-21**: "No prophecy of Scripture comes from someone's own interpretation. For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit"
- **1 Corinthians 2:13**: "We impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit"

### Inerrancy and Infallibility
**Westminster Confession of Faith (1.4)**: "The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed, and obeyed, dependeth not upon the testimony of any man, or Church; but wholly upon God (who is truth itself) the author thereof: and therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of God."

**Definitions**:
- **Inerrancy**: Scripture is without error in all it affirms
- **Infallibility**: Scripture cannot lead us astray in matters of faith and practice
- **Authority**: Scripture has the right to command belief and obedience

**R.C. Sproul**: "If the Bible errs in telling us about the physical world, why should we trust it when it tells us about the spiritual world?"

## üèõÔ∏è Reformed Hermeneutical Principles

### Scripture Interprets Scripture
**Principle**: Use clear biblical passages to interpret difficult or unclear passages

**John Calvin**: "Scripture is its own interpreter. Nothing can be expected beyond what the Scripture teaches."

**Application**:
- **Analogy of faith**: Interpret unclear passages by clear passages
- **Progressive revelation**: Later revelation clarifies earlier revelation
- **Systematic theology**: Build doctrine from multiple biblical texts
- **Context determines meaning**: Historical, literary, and canonical context

### Grammatical-Historical Method
**R.C. Sproul**: "The task of the interpreter is to determine what the original author intended to communicate to his original audience."

**Key Elements**:
- **Original languages**: Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek are authoritative
- **Historical context**: When, where, and why it was written
- **Literary genre**: Poetry, narrative, prophecy, epistle, etc.
- **Cultural background**: Understanding ancient Near Eastern context

### Christ-Centered Interpretation
**Luke 24:27**: "And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself."

**John Piper**: "The Bible is one book. It is the story of God's glory in the salvation of sinners through the substitutionary sacrifice and triumphant resurrection of Jesus Christ."

**Application**:
- **Old Testament typology**: Persons, events, and institutions point to Christ
- **Covenant unity**: One covenant of grace progressively revealed
- **Redemptive-historical reading**: See God's salvation plan throughout Scripture

## üìö Reformed Theologians on Biblical Authority

### John MacArthur's Contribution
**"How to Study the Bible"** and **MacArthur Study Bible**:
- Emphasis on expository preaching method
- Careful attention to original languages and context
- Application of sound hermeneutical principles
- Integration of systematic theology with biblical exegesis

**Key Quotes**:
- "The Bible interprets itself. Scripture is the best commentary on Scripture."
- "Expository preaching is the proclamation of the truth of God as mediated through the preacher."

### R.C. Sproul's Apologetic Defense
**"Scripture Alone"** and **"Knowing Scripture"**:
- Philosophical defense of biblical authority
- Historical development of canon formation
- Response to higher critical challenges
- Practical application of hermeneutical principles

**Key Insights**:
- "The Bible is not a human book with a divine element; it is a divine book with a human element."
- "If we do not have an infallible Scripture, we do not have an authoritative word from God."

### John Piper's Supernatural Reading
**"Reading the Bible Supernaturally"**:
- Role of Holy Spirit in illumination
- Natural and supernatural elements in Bible reading
- Seeing and savoring God's glory through Scripture
- Prayer and humility in Bible study

**Framework**:
- **Natural reading**: Grammatical-historical method
- **Supernatural reading**: Holy Spirit illumination
- **Both necessary**: Human effort and divine enablement
- **Goal**: See God's glory and be transformed by it

## üõ°Ô∏è Defending Biblical Authority

### Contemporary Challenges
**Higher Criticism**:
- **Documentary Hypothesis**: JEDP theory of Pentateuch
- **Form Criticism**: Oral tradition development theories
- **Redaction Criticism**: Editorial process assumptions
- **Reformed Response**: Archaeological and textual evidence supports traditional authorship

**Postmodern Challenges**:
- **Relativistic interpretation**: "That's just your interpretation"
- **Cultural conditioning**: "Bible reflects ancient prejudices"
- **Reformed Response**: Objective truth and clear communication

### Apologetic Strategies
**Internal Evidence**:
- **Unity of Scripture**: Consistent message across 66 books and 1,500 years
- **Fulfilled prophecy**: Specific predictions accurately fulfilled
- **Scientific accuracy**: No genuine contradictions with established science
- **Historical reliability**: Archaeological confirmation of biblical accounts

**External Evidence**:
- **Manuscript evidence**: Superior to all other ancient documents
- **Early dating**: Close to events described
- **Eyewitness testimony**: Authors were present or interviewed witnesses
- **Canonical recognition**: Early church acknowledged divine authorship

### John MacArthur on Inerrancy Debates
**"The Battle for the Beginning"** and seminary positions:
- Clear stance against theistic evolution
- Defense of literal six-day creation
- Historical Adam and Eve as essential to gospel
- Inerrancy includes historical and scientific statements
