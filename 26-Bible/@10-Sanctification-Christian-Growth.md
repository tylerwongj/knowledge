## üî• John Piper's Christian Hedonism

### Core Principle
**"God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him."**

#### Biblical Foundation
**Primary Texts**:
- **Psalm 37:4**: "Delight yourself in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart"
- **Psalm 16:11**: "In your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore"
- **John 15:11**: "These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full"
- **Philippians 4:4**: "Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice"

#### Theological Framework
**John Piper**: "The chief end of man is to glorify God by enjoying Him forever. We were made to know and treasure God above all things; and when we do, we glorify Him precisely because He is the kind of being who is most honored when we are most satisfied in Him."

**Key Insights**:
- Joy in God is commanded, not optional (Philippians 4:4)
- Duty and delight unite in Christian experience
- God's glory and our joy converge in worship
- Pursuit of happiness in God is righteous, not selfish

### The Fight for Joy

#### John Piper's Framework for Sanctification
**"Desiring God"** - The foundational work explaining Christian Hedonism:

**1. The Supremacy of God in Christian Living**
- All of life exists for God's glory
- Our satisfaction in God displays His supreme worth
- Sin is preferring other pleasures over God
- Holiness is treasuring God above all competing affections

**2. The Pleasure of God in Christian Growth**
- God delights in our delight in Him
- Spiritual disciplines serve to strengthen joy in God
- Bible reading, prayer, worship designed to increase God-satisfaction
- Community and service flow from overflowing joy

#### Practical Sanctification Strategy
**"When I Don't Desire God"** - Piper's approach to spiritual dryness:

**ANTHEM Acrostic**:
- **A**dmit your condition honestly before God
- **N**ew focus on the cross and God's love
- **T**alking to God about the problem (prayer)
- **H**andle God's Word, especially promises
- **E**xercise your body and get adequate sleep
- **M**inistry to others in their needs

## üèîÔ∏è Reformed Sanctification Theology

### Biblical Definition
**Sanctification**: The progressive work of God and man in which the corruption of sin is more and more eliminated and we are more and more renewed in the whole man after the image of God through the work of the Holy Spirit in us.

### Three Aspects of Sanctification

#### 1. Definitive Sanctification (Positional)
**Biblical Basis**: 1 Corinthians 6:11, Hebrews 10:10
- **Definition**: One-time separation to God at conversion
- **Nature**: Complete and perfect in Christ
- **Practical Implication**: Believers are "saints" regardless of maturity level

**John MacArthur**: "Every believer has been sanctified positionally - set apart as holy to God. This is not progressive; it is a completed reality."

#### 2. Progressive Sanctification (Experiential)  
**Biblical Basis**: 2 Corinthians 3:18, Philippians 2:12-13
- **Definition**: Ongoing process of becoming more like Christ
- **Nature**: Gradual growth in holiness throughout life
- **Practical Implication**: Daily surrender and spiritual discipline required

**John Piper**: "Progressive sanctification is the gradual conforming of our affections to the supreme worth of God. We grow in holiness as we grow in satisfaction in God."

#### 3. Ultimate Sanctification (Glorification)
**Biblical Basis**: 1 John 3:2, 1 Corinthians 15:51-52
- **Definition**: Complete perfection at death/resurrection
- **Nature**: Instantaneous and final
- **Practical Implication**: Hope that motivates present growth

### Reformed Distinctives in Sanctification

#### Role of the Holy Spirit
**Galatians 5:16**: "Walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh"

**Martyn Lloyd-Jones**: "The Holy Spirit does not improve the old nature; He gives us a new nature. Sanctification is not the improvement of the old man but the putting on of the new man."

**Key Principles**:
- Spirit enables what He commands
- Mortification and vivification work together
- Fruit of the Spirit vs. works of the flesh
- Spirit's work through means of grace

#### Role of Human Effort
**Philippians 2:12-13**: "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you"

**John Owen**: "Be killing sin or it will be killing you."

**Balance**:
- God's sovereignty and human responsibility
- Effort without legalism
- Grace-enabled obedience
- Active pursuit of holiness

## üìñ Spiritual Disciplines for Growth

### John Piper's Approach to Spiritual Disciplines

#### Bible Reading for Joy

- **Evening**: Psalm for worship and praise
- **Weekly**: Sermon meditation and application

#### Prayer as Communion
**"A Godward Life"**:
- Prayer as means of grace, not just requests
- Adoration, confession, thanksgiving, supplication (ACTS)
- Intercession as overflow of God-satisfaction
- Contemplative prayer and meditation

**Prayer Framework**:
- **Adoration**: Focus on God's attributes and works
- **Confession**: Honest acknowledgment of sin and need

#### Worship and Corporate Gathering
**"Worship: The Reason We Were Born"**:

### Reformed Spiritual Disciplines

#### Mortification and Vivification
**John Owen's "Mortification of Sin"**:

**Mortification** (Putting Sin to Death):
- Daily recognition of indwelling sin
- Specific confession and repentance
- Cutting off sin's supply lines (occasions, temptations)
- Reliance on Holy Spirit's power

**Vivification** (Making Alive):
- Cultivation of opposite virtues
- Meditation on gospel promises
- Active pursuit of righteousness
- Growth in love for God and others

#### Puritan Approach to Sanctification
**Richard Baxter's "Christian Directory"**:

- Regular self-examination and confession
- Accountability in Christian community
- Practical wisdom for Christian living

**Jonathan Edwards' "Religious Affections"**:
- True religion consists in holy affections
- Heart engagement, not mere intellectual assent
- Fruit-bearing as evidence of genuine conversion
- Balance of emotion and reason in spirituality

## üé≠ Joy vs. Duty: Piper's Revolutionary Insight

### Traditional False Dichotomy
**Old Paradigm**: Duty vs. Pleasure
- Serve God out of obligation
- Suppress desire for personal happiness
- Sacrifice joy for righteousness
- Feel guilty about enjoying God

### Piper's Biblical Integration
**New Paradigm**: Duty through Delight
- Serve God from overflowing joy
- Pursue satisfaction in God as righteousness
- Find joy as pathway to holiness
- Celebrate God-given desires

#### Biblical Support for Christian Hedonism
**Matthew 13:44**: "The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up. Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field."

**Piper's Analysis**: "The man sells everything not with grim resolve but with overflowing joy. Joy in the treasure makes the sacrifice not a sacrifice but the smart thing to do."
