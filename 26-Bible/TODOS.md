## üí° **WHY THIS ORDER?**

**John Piper**: "We don't just study the Bible to know it, but to be transformed by it for God's glory and our joy."

**John MacArthur**: "The Bible is practical theology - it's meant to be lived out in daily obedience."

The **thematic approach** focuses on practical biblical principles you'll use daily, rather than academic book studies. Once you have solid life foundations, you can dive deeper into individual Bible books.

**Priority**: Life application themes ‚Üí Study tools ‚Üí Book studies ‚Üí Historical context ‚Üí Advanced studies
