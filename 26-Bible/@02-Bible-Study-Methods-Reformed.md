# @02-Bible-Study-Methods-Reformed - Reformed Hermeneutical Approach

## üéØ Learning Objectives
- Master Reformed hermeneutical principles for biblical interpretation
- Develop systematic expository study method following MacArthur's approach
- Apply Scripture-interprets-Scripture methodology
- Build consistent devotional practices grounded in Reformed theology

## üìñ Reformed Hermeneutical Foundation

### Scripture Interprets Scripture Principle
**John Calvin**: "Scripture is its own interpreter. Nothing can be expected beyond what the Scripture teaches."

**R.C. Sproul**: "The Bible is the best commentary on the Bible. When we encounter difficult passages, we should look to clearer passages for understanding."

**Application Method**:
1. **Identify difficult or unclear passages**
2. **Search for clearer passages** on same topic
3. **Use systematic theology** to organize biblical teaching
4. **Build doctrine** from multiple biblical witnesses

### Grammatical-Historical Method
**John MacArthur**: "The task of biblical interpretation is to determine what God meant when He inspired the biblical authors to write."

**Key Principles**:
- **Original languages**: Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek determine meaning
- **Historical context**: Author, audience, date, circumstances
- **Literary context**: Genre, structure, flow of argument
- **Cultural background**: Ancient Near Eastern customs and practices

### Progressive Revelation Framework
**Reformed Understanding**: God reveals Himself progressively throughout Scripture, with fuller revelation building on earlier revelation.

**Application**:
- **Old Testament types** point to New Testament fulfillment
- **Covenant development** from creation to consummation
- **Christ as interpretive key** to all Scripture (Luke 24:27)
- **Unity of Scripture** across both testaments

## üîç Reformed Study Methods

### 1. Expository Study Method (MacArthur's Approach)

#### Step 1: Observation - "What Does the Text Say?"
**Detailed Text Analysis**:
- Read passage 5-7 times in different translations (ESV, NASB, NKJV)
- Note key words, repeated terms, conjunctions, verb tenses
- Identify literary structure, outline, flow of thought
- Mark questions that arise during reading

**Reformed Emphasis**: 
- **Authorial intent**: What did the human author intend to communicate?
- **Divine intent**: What did God intend to reveal through this text?
- **Historical reliability**: Trust the biblical account as historically accurate

#### Step 2: Interpretation - "What Does the Text Mean?"
**Contextual Analysis**:
- **Immediate context**: Surrounding verses and chapters
- **Book context**: How passage fits in author's overall argument
- **Biblical context**: How text relates to rest of Scripture
- **Historical context**: What did it mean to original audience?

**Reformed Tools**:
- **Scripture cross-references**: Let Bible interpret Bible
- **Reformed commentaries**: MacArthur, Sproul, Calvin, Lloyd-Jones
- **Systematic theology**: How text fits Reformed doctrinal framework
- **Original language study**: Strong's, Vine's, BDAG lexicon

#### Step 3: Application - "How Does This Apply Today?"
**Reformed Application Principles**:
- **Universal principles**: Timeless truths from cultural specifics
- **Gospel connection**: How does this text point to Christ?
- **Sanctification**: How does this promote growth in holiness?
- **Practical obedience**: Specific steps for applying truth

### 2. Systematic Theological Study
**Building Doctrine from Scripture**

**Method**:
1. **Choose doctrinal topic** (justification, sanctification, etc.)
2. **Gather all relevant passages** using concordance and cross-references
3. **Study each passage** in context using grammatical-historical method
4. **Organize findings** into coherent theological statement
5. **Compare with Reformed confessions** (Westminster, etc.)

**Reformed Emphasis**:
- **Sola Scriptura**: Scripture alone as source for doctrine
- **Systematic consistency**: Doctrine must be consistent across all Scripture
- **Confessional framework**: Historic Reformed creeds provide guidance
- **Practical implications**: Doctrine must inform Christian living

### 3. Redemptive-Historical Study
**Seeing Christ Throughout Scripture**

**John Piper**: "The Bible is one book. It is the story of God's glory in the salvation of sinners through the substitutionary sacrifice and triumphant resurrection of Jesus Christ."

**Method**:
1. **Identify the text's place** in redemptive history
2. **Look for types and shadows** pointing to Christ
3. **Connect to covenant promises** and their fulfillment
4. **Apply Christological focus** to personal spiritual growth

**Examples**:
- **Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac**: Points to God's sacrifice of His Son
- **Passover lamb**: Types Christ as our sacrificial lamb
- **David as king**: Foreshadows Christ as eternal King
- **Temple worship**: Points to Christ as perfect High Priest

### 4. Devotional Study Method (Puritan Approach)

#### Morning Devotional Structure
**Richard Baxter's Approach**:
1. **Prayer for illumination**: Ask Holy Spirit for understanding
2. **Scripture reading**: Systematic through Bible or by topic
3. **Meditation**: Reflect on God's character and promises
4. **Self-examination**: How does text reveal sin or growth areas?
5. **Prayer response**: Adoration, confession, thanksgiving, supplication

#### Evening Reflection
**Jonathan Edwards' Practice**:
- **Review the day**: How did I apply morning's Scripture?
- **Examine heart motives**: What idols competed with God today?
- **Confess specific sins**: Be honest about failures and weaknesses
- **Thank God for grace**: Focus on undeserved mercy and love
