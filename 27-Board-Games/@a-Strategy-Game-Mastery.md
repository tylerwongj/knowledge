## üöÄ AI-Enhanced Learning Strategies

### Game Analysis Tools
```
Prompt: "Analyze this board game position [describe current state]. Identify the top 3 strategic moves, explain the reasoning behind each, and predict likely opponent responses."

Input: Game state, player positions, available actions
Output: Strategic analysis with move recommendations and tactical reasoning
```

### Strategy Development
```
Prompt: "I'm learning [game name]. Create a comprehensive strategy guide covering opening moves, mid-game transitions, and end-game optimization. Include common mistakes to avoid."

Context: Game rules, personal play style preferences, skill level
Output: Detailed strategy guide with tactical examples
```

### Opponent Modeling
```
Prompt: "Based on these observed behaviors [list player actions/patterns], create a psychological profile and suggest counter-strategies for future games."

Data: Player behavior patterns, decision tendencies, risk preferences
Output: Opponent analysis with exploitation strategies
```
