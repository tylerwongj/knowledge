# @b-Game Design Mechanics

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
- Understand fundamental game mechanics and their interactions
- Learn how mechanics create player engagement and strategic depth
- Master the relationship between theme and mechanics
- Develop ability to analyze and critique game design choices

## ðŸ”§ Core Game Mechanics

### Resource Management
- **Collection**: Gathering materials, money, or points
- **Conversion**: Transforming one resource type into another
- **Scarcity**: Limited availability creating competition
- **Storage**: Capacity limits and timing decisions

### Action Selection
- **Worker Placement**: Limited action spaces with blocking
- **Action Points**: Flexible allocation of limited actions
- **Role Selection**: Choosing from available role cards
- **Simultaneous Selection**: Hidden choices revealed together

### Conflict Resolution
- **Direct Conflict**: Combat with dice, cards, or comparison
- **Area Majority**: Controlling territories through presence
- **Competitive Bidding**: Auction mechanics for resources
- **Blocking**: Preventing opponent actions

### Information Management
- **Hidden Information**: Private hands, secret objectives
- **Perfect Information**: All game state visible to players
- **Simultaneous Revelation**: Coordinated information sharing
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information revealed over time

## ðŸŽ¨ Thematic Integration

### Mechanical Harmony
- Mechanics that naturally support the theme
- Actions that feel intuitive within the game world
- Components that enhance thematic immersion
- Victory conditions that align with narrative goals

### Abstraction vs. Simulation
- Finding the right level of detail for gameplay
- Balancing realism with playability
- Using abstraction to focus on key decisions
- Maintaining thematic coherence while simplifying

## ðŸ”„ Player Interaction Types

### Direct Interaction
- **Attacking**: Direct harm or resource removal
- **Trading**: Negotiated resource exchange
- **Cooperation**: Mutual benefit scenarios
- **Blocking**: Preventing specific opponent actions

### Indirect Interaction
- **Market Effects**: Actions affecting shared resources
- **Tempo Competition**: Racing for limited objectives
- **Spatial Pressure**: Territory and positioning competition
- **Information Warfare**: Bluffing and hidden information

## ðŸš€ AI/LLM Integration Opportunities

### Design Analysis
- Generate mechanic combination matrices for new designs
- Create balance analysis reports for existing games
- Develop playtesting scenarios and edge cases
- Automate rules complexity analysis and scoring

### Development Tools
- Generate prototype component lists and specifications
- Create rulebook templates and structure guides
- Develop cost analysis for production and materials
- Automate market research for similar games and themes

### Community Engagement
- Generate designer interview questions and profiles
- Create game recommendation engines based on mechanics
- Develop crowdfunding campaign analysis and optimization
- Automate review aggregation and sentiment analysis

## ðŸ’¡ Key Highlights

- **Mechanics Serve Experience**: Every mechanic should contribute to the intended player experience
- **Interaction Creates Engagement**: Players need meaningful ways to affect each other
- **Simplicity Enables Depth**: Complex interactions can emerge from simple rules
- **Balance Through Asymmetry**: Different player powers can create balanced gameplay
- **Feedback Loops**: Mechanics should create interesting decision cascades throughout the game
