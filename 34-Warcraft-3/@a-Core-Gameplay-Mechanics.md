4. **Supply Buildings** ‚Üí Farms, Moon Wells, Burrows, Ziggurats
5. **Tech Buildings** ‚Üí Advanced units and upgrades

### Worker Management
- **Optimal Workers**: 5 workers per gold mine, 5 per lumber mill
- **Expansion Timing**: When main gold mine depletes to ~50%
- **Worker Distribution**: Balance between resource gathering and building
