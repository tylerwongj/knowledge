## ðŸ”§ BGA Interface Mastery

### Draft Interface Optimization

**Card Selection Efficiency:**
```
Mouse Workflow:
1. Hover over cards for instant preview
2. Right-click for detailed card view
3. Single-click to select and confirm
4. Use keyboard shortcuts when available
```

**Information Processing:**
- **Card Preview**: Hover for quick effect reading
- **Deck View**: Track drafted cards systematically  
- **Pass Direction**: Always confirm direction indicator
- **Pack Progress**: Monitor pick numbers for timing

**Time Management:**
```
Draft Timer Strategy:
- First 3 picks: 20-30 seconds each (high impact decisions)
- Middle picks: 15-20 seconds each (strategy refinement)
- Final picks: 10-15 seconds each (efficiency focus)
- Buffer time: Save 10-15 seconds for complex decisions
```

### Game Interface Efficiency

**Action Selection Speed:**
- **Familiarize Shortcuts**: Learn all keyboard shortcuts
- **Pre-plan Actions**: Think ahead during opponents' turns
- **Quick Confirmation**: Use enter/space for standard actions
- **Batch Operations**: Group similar actions when possible

**Resource Tracking:**
```
Mental Tracking System:
- Current Resources: Wood/Clay/Reed/Stone/Food counts
- Production Capacity: What you can generate per round
- Consumption Needs: Family feeding requirements
- Action Economy: Available actions vs. desired actions
```

**Board State Analysis:**
- **Action Space Availability**: Track blocked spaces
- **Resource Generation**: Monitor replenishment rates
- **Opponent Tracking**: Note opponent strategies and resources
- **Timing Windows**: Identify critical action timing

## ðŸš€ Strategic Decision Automation

### Decision Tree Templates

**Standard Opening Patterns:**
```
Round 1 Decision Tree:
â”œâ”€ Starting Player Available? 
â”‚  â”œâ”€ Yes â†’ Take if no premium resources needed
â”‚  â””â”€ No â†’ Evaluate basic resources (Wood/Clay priority)
â”œâ”€ Premium Resources (3+ of one type)?
â”‚  â”œâ”€ Yes â†’ Take for early infrastructure
â”‚  â””â”€ No â†’ Consider Day Laborer or basic accumulation
â””â”€ Family Growth viable? (8+ food)
   â”œâ”€ Yes â†’ Take if early expansion beneficial
   â””â”€ No â†’ Focus on resource foundation
```

**Mid-Game Action Priority:**
```
Action Priority Framework:
1. Family Growth (if food secure + beneficial)
2. Premium Card Play (high-impact occupations/improvements)
3. Resource Generation (when building/playing cards)
4. Building Actions (when materials available + beneficial)
5. Basic Resource Collection (when other actions unavailable)
```

### Automated Evaluation Systems

**Card Play Decision Matrix:**
```
Should I Play This Card Now?
â”œâ”€ Do I have required resources? (Yes/No)
â”œâ”€ Will this generate more value than waiting? (Yes/No)
â”œâ”€ Does this enable future plays? (Yes/No)  
â”œâ”€ Am I likely to draw better options? (Yes/No)
â””â”€ Decision: Play if 3+ Yes answers
```

**Resource Allocation Formula:**
```
Priority Allocation:
1. Family Feeding (mandatory 2 food per member)
2. Card Activation (resources for planned plays)
3. Building Materials (house renovation + infrastructure)
4. Expansion Resources (fields, pastures, room additions)
5. Excess Conversion (turn surplus into points)
```

## ðŸ’¡ Time Pressure Management

### Rapid Decision Frameworks

**30-Second Draft Pick Process:**
```
Step 1 (5 sec): Scan for premium cards (Tier S/A)
Step 2 (10 sec): Evaluate top 3 options against strategy
Step 3 (10 sec): Consider signals and opponent impact
Step 4 (5 sec): Make decision and confirm
```

**Quick Action Selection:**
```
10-Second Action Process:
Step 1 (3 sec): Identify viable actions for current turn
Step 2 (4 sec): Evaluate immediate vs. long-term value
Step 3 (3 sec): Select and confirm action
```

### Cognitive Load Reduction

**Pre-Game Preparation:**
- **Card Familiarity**: Know all cards by name and effect
- **Strategy Templates**: Have 3-5 go-to strategies memorized
- **Common Patterns**: Recognize frequent game states
- **Decision Shortcuts**: Develop heuristics for common choices

**Mental Models:**
```
Resource Conversion Rates (memorize):
- 1 Wood + 1 Clay + 1 Reed = 1 Room
- 2 Food = Feed 1 family member for 1 harvest
- 1 Grain â†’ Plant â†’ Harvest = 2-3 Food potential
- 1 Animal Space = 1-3 points depending on animal type
```
