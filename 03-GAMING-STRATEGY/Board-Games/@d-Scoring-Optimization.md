## ðŸ”§ Scoring System Breakdown

### Core Scoring Categories
```
Grain Fields: 1 point per field (-1 for 0 fields)
Pastures: 1 point per pasture (-1 for 0 pastures)  
Grain: 1 point per grain (-1 for 0 grain)
Vegetables: 1 point per vegetable (-1 for 0 vegetables)
Sheep: 1 point per sheep (-1 for 0 sheep)
Wild Boar: 2 points per boar (-1 for 0 boar)
Cattle: 3 points per cattle (-1 for 0 cattle)
Unused Farm Squares: -1 point per unused space
Family Members: 3 points per family member
Clay Huts/Stone Houses: 0/1 point per room
Fencing: 0 points (but enables pastures)
Stables: 0 points (but enables animal capacity)
Major/Minor Improvements: Variable bonus points
Occupations: Variable bonus points and effects
Begging Cards: -3 points each
```

### Scoring Priority Matrix

**High Value Density (3+ points per resource invested):**
- **Cattle**: 3 points each, highest animal value
- **Family Members**: 3 points each, enable more actions
- **Village Elder Bonus**: Multiplies existing categories

**Medium Value Density (1-2 points per resource):**
- **Wild Boar**: 2 points each, moderate investment
- **Individual Categories**: 1 point per grain/vegetable/sheep
- **Stone House Rooms**: 1 point per room upgrade

**Low Value Density (0-1 points per resource):**
- **Grain Fields**: 1 point per field, requires seed investment
- **Pastures**: 1 point per pasture, requires fencing
- **Clay Hut Rooms**: 0 points, just avoids negatives

## ðŸš€ Draft-Specific Scoring Strategies

### Engine-Based Scoring Approach

**Food Engine â†’ Family Growth:**
- Priority: Draft food generation (Wet Nurse, Grocer, Cooking)
- Execution: Maximize family members (3 points each)
- Supporting Cards: Additional food sources, cooking facilities
- Risk Mitigation: Backup food sources, harvest preparation

**Animal Husbandry Focus:**
- Priority: Draft animal generation and capacity cards
- Execution: Cattle > Wild Boar > Sheep progression
- Supporting Cards: Pasture creation, animal breeding, feeding
- Risk Mitigation: Diverse animal types, sufficient pastures

**Improvement Scoring:**
- Priority: Draft high-scoring Minor Improvements
- Execution: Focus on cards with direct point values
- Supporting Cards: Resource generation for activation
- Risk Mitigation: Playable improvements over powerful ones

### Category Completion Strategy

**Avoiding Negatives (-1 point penalties):**
```
Minimum Viable Targets:
- 1 Grain Field (avoid -1)
- 1 Pasture (avoid -1)  
- 1 Grain (avoid -1)
- 1 Vegetable (avoid -1)
- 1 Sheep (avoid -1)
- 1 Wild Boar (avoid -1)
- 1 Cattle (avoid -1)
```

**Efficiency Thresholds:**
- **Break-even**: 1 of each category = 0 net points
- **Positive Value**: 2+ in each category = positive contribution
- **Optimization**: Focus resources on highest-return categories

## ðŸ’¡ Advanced Scoring Calculations

### Point Per Action Analysis

**Family Growth Calculation:**
```
Base Value: 3 points per family member
Action Multiplier: +1 action per round for remaining rounds
Total Value: 3 + (actions gained Ã— average action value)
Optimal Timing: Earlier = higher total value
```

**Animal Investment ROI:**
```
Cattle: 3 points, requires 1 pasture space + food
Wild Boar: 2 points, requires 1 pasture space + food  
Sheep: 1 point, requires 1 pasture space + food
ROI Priority: Cattle > Wild Boar > Sheep (when space allows)
```

**Resource-to-Point Conversion:**
```
Direct Conversion: 1 resource = 1 point (grain/vegetables)
Animal Conversion: Resources â†’ Animals = 1-3 points
Building Conversion: Resources â†’ Rooms = 0-1 points
Efficiency Order: Animals > Direct > Building (generally)
```

### Endgame Point Optimization

**Final Round Priorities (Round 14):**
1. **Convert Resources**: All remaining grain/vegetables = points
2. **Complete Categories**: Fill any 0-value categories to avoid -1
3. **Animal Breeding**: If pasture space available
4. **Improvement Activation**: Any remaining playable cards

**Point Calculation Decision Tree:**
```
Available Action â†’ Potential Points
â”œâ”€ Animal Acquisition (if space) â†’ 1-3 points
â”œâ”€ Resource Collection â†’ 1 point per grain/vegetable
â”œâ”€ Category Completion â†’ +1 point (avoids -1 penalty)
â””â”€ Building/Improvement â†’ 0-1 points + utility
```

## ðŸ”§ Draft Synergy Scoring

### High-Synergy Combinations

**Village Elder Engine:**
- **Setup**: Diversify development across categories
- **Multiplier Effect**: +1 point per type of development
- **Optimization**: Maximize different categories over deep focus
- **Target**: 7+ different development types

**Specialist Worker Combos:**
- **Field Warden**: +1 point per grain field (incentivizes field focus)
- **Shepherd**: Enhanced sheep value (makes sheep competitive)
- **Cattle Rancher**: Enhanced cattle management (more cattle viable)

**Improvement Synergies:**
- **Cooking Facilities + Food Production**: Enables family growth
- **Clay Oven + Grain**: Bread production for points and food
- **Well + Cooking**: Enhanced food conversion efficiency

### Point Density Optimization

**High-Density Strategies:**
- **Cattle Focus**: 3 points per animal, highest individual value
- **Family Maximization**: 3 points per member + action economy
- **Diverse Development**: Village Elder multiplication effect

**Medium-Density Strategies:**
- **Wild Boar Specialization**: 2 points per animal, easier than cattle
- **Improvement Collection**: Variable points, often 1-2 per card
- **Mixed Animal Approach**: Diversified risk, moderate returns

**Low-Density Strategies:**
- **Field Expansion**: 1 point per field, high resource investment
- **Room Addition**: 0-1 points per room, primarily utility
- **Single Category Depth**: Diminishing returns after avoiding negatives

## ðŸ’¡ Key Strategic Insights

### Timing-Based Scoring Decisions

**Early Game Scoring Setup:**
- Focus on engines that enable scoring later
- Avoid immediate point generation in favor of multipliers
- Establish resource flows for sustainable point generation

**Mid Game Scoring Acceleration:**
- Deploy point-generating engines when resources allow
- Balance current points vs. future potential
- Begin category completion to avoid negatives

**Late Game Scoring Maximization:**
- Convert all resources to points immediately
- Complete any remaining categories
- Play all remaining point-generating cards

### Common Scoring Mistakes

1. **Negative Category Trap**: Focusing on high-value animals while neglecting basic categories
2. **Resource Hoarding**: Keeping grain/vegetables instead of converting to points
3. **Engine Over-Investment**: Building scoring engines too late for adequate payoff
4. **Inefficient Actions**: Taking low-value actions when higher-value available
5. **Category Tunnel Vision**: Over-investing in single categories vs. diversification

### Pro-Level Scoring Optimization

**Marginal Value Analysis:**
- Calculate point-per-action for each possible move
- Consider opportunity costs of different scoring paths
- Adjust strategy based on opponent scoring potential

**Risk-Adjusted Scoring:**
- Balance guaranteed points vs. potential high-value plays
- Consider probability of successful execution
- Maintain backup plans for primary scoring strategies

**Meta-Game Scoring:**
- Understand common scoring benchmarks in draft format
- Recognize when to pivot from engine building to pure scoring
- Optimize for winning margin rather than absolute points
