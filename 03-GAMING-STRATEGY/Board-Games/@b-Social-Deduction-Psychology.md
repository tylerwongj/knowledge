## üöÄ AI-Enhanced Analysis

### Player Profiling
```
Prompt: "Based on these observed behaviors in social deduction games [list specific actions, voting patterns, speech patterns], create a psychological profile including likely personality traits, gameplay tendencies, and optimal counter-strategies."

Input: Player behavior data, game outcomes, interaction patterns
Output: Comprehensive player analysis with exploitation strategies
```

### Deception Detection
```
Prompt: "Analyze this conversation from a social deduction game [transcript]. Identify potential lies, inconsistencies, and suspicious patterns. Rank players by likelihood of being deceptive with reasoning."

Data: Game transcript, voting records, player interactions
Output: Deception probability analysis with supporting evidence
```

### Strategy Optimization
```
Prompt: "I'm playing [specific role] in [game name]. Given the current game state [describe situation], what are the optimal moves to maximize win probability? Include psychological manipulation tactics."

Context: Role, game state, player dynamics, previous interactions
Output: Strategic action plan with psychological tactics
```
