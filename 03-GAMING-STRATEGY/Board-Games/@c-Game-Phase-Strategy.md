- Develop adaptive play patterns based on draft picks

## ðŸ”§ Game Phase Breakdown

### Phase Structure Overview
```
Early Game: Rounds 1-5 (Foundation Building)
Mid Game: Rounds 6-10 (Engine Development)  
Late Game: Rounds 11-14 (Point Maximization)
```

**Key Phase Transitions:**
- **Round 5â†’6**: First Harvest, family growth becomes viable
- **Round 9â†’10**: Second Harvest, resource abundance peaks
- **Round 13â†’14**: Final Harvest, point generation critical

## ðŸš€ Early Game Strategy (Rounds 1-5)

### Core Objectives
1. **Resource Foundation**: Establish sustainable resource generation
2. **Infrastructure Building**: Play cheap Minor Improvements
3. **Family Growth Prep**: Accumulate food for first harvest
4. **Opportunity Recognition**: Identify undervalued action spaces

### Optimal Card Play Sequence

**Round 1-2 Priority:**
- **Minor Improvements**: Fireplace, Basket, Basic Tools
- **Early Occupations**: Wet Nurse (if food secure), Day Laborer
- **Action Priorities**: Starting Player, Basic Resources

**Round 3-4 Focus:**
- **Infrastructure**: Well, Plow, Cooking facilities
- **Resource Engines**: Private Forest, Clay Pit
- **Family Growth**: If food engine established

**Round 5 Preparation:**
- **Harvest Security**: Ensure 2 food per family member
- **Growth Timing**: Take Family Growth if beneficial
- **Card Setup**: Position engines for mid-game activation

### Resource Curve Management

**Optimal Early Curve:**
```
R1-2: 3-4 Wood, 2-3 Clay, 1-2 Reed, 4-5 Food
R3-4: 5-6 Wood, 3-4 Clay, 2-3 Reed, 6-8 Food  
R5: 4-5 Wood, 3-4 Clay, 2-3 Reed, 8+ Food
```

**Critical Thresholds:**
- **Food Security**: 2+ food per family member
- **Building Materials**: Enough for house renovation
- **Tool Investment**: 1-2 tools for action efficiency

## ðŸ’¡ Mid Game Strategy (Rounds 6-10)

### Strategic Pivots
1. **Engine Activation**: Deploy key Occupations and improvements
2. **Scaling Focus**: Maximize resource multiplication
3. **Board Position**: Secure valuable action spaces
4. **Competition Management**: Block opponents' key actions

### Power Turn Execution

**Round 6-7 Engines:**
- **Occupation Deployment**: High-impact workers with good ROI
- **Improvement Synergy**: Cards that enhance resource conversion
- **Action Optimization**: Use tools for efficient multi-actions

**Round 8-9 Scaling:**
- **Resource Multiplication**: Private Forest + Wood conversion
- **Food Engines**: Cooking facilities + grain/vegetable production  
- **Building Strategy**: House renovation if beneficial

**Round 10 Positioning:**
- **Pre-Harvest Setup**: Secure food for second harvest
- **Engine Completion**: Deploy remaining key cards
- **Competitive Advantage**: Establish hard-to-contest positions

### Card Deployment Timing

**High Priority Timing:**
- **Wet Nurse**: Round 6-7 for maximum family growth benefit
- **Village Elder**: Round 8-9 for endgame scoring setup
- **Grocer**: Round 7-8 for food engine establishment

**Medium Priority Timing:**
- **Specialty Workers**: When specific resources needed
- **Conversion Cards**: When raw materials abundant
- **Scoring Engines**: Mid-to-late for maximum value

## ðŸ”§ Late Game Strategy (Rounds 11-14)

### Endgame Optimization
1. **Point Maximization**: Focus on scoring rather than building
2. **Efficiency Priority**: Every action must generate value
3. **Completion Focus**: Finish scoring categories
4. **Resource Conversion**: Transform materials into points

### Final Phase Execution

**Round 11-12 Priorities:**
- **Scoring Engines**: Deploy point-generating cards
- **Completion Bonuses**: Fill animal types, grain varieties
- **Action Efficiency**: Use accumulated tools effectively

**Round 13-14 Critical Path:**
- **Point Generation**: Every action focused on scoring
- **Resource Spending**: Convert all materials to points
- **Final Improvements**: Last-minute efficiency cards

### Endgame Card Values

**High Value Late:**
- **Village Elder**: Multiplies existing development
- **Traveling Players**: Direct point generation
- **Specialty Scoring**: Cards that complete categories

**Low Value Late:**
- **Resource Engines**: No time for payoff
- **Expensive Occupations**: ROI insufficient
- **Infrastructure**: Building phase complete

## ðŸš€ Advanced Phase Management

### Adaptive Strategy Patterns

**Resource Abundance Pattern:**
- Early: Establish engines quickly
- Mid: Scale aggressively with excess resources  
- Late: Convert abundance to points efficiently

**Resource Scarcity Pattern:**
- Early: Focus on efficiency and basics
- Mid: Maximize every resource gained
- Late: Precise resource-to-point conversion

**Competition Heavy Pattern:**
- Early: Secure contested spaces early
- Mid: Block opponents while advancing
- Late: Deny key scoring opportunities

### Phase-Specific Card Synergies

**Early Game Combos:**
- Fireplace + Grain/Vegetables = Food security
- Plow + Grain = Long-term food engine
- Basket + Day Laborer = Resource acceleration

**Mid Game Engines:**
- Wet Nurse + Family Growth = Worker advantage
- Private Forest + Carpenter = Building materials
- Grocer + Cooking = Food engine scaling

**Late Game Finishers:**
- Village Elder + Diverse Development = Scoring multiplier
- Traveling Players + Unused Actions = Emergency points
- Specialty Workers + Specific Resources = Category completion

## ðŸ’¡ AI/LLM Integration Opportunities

### Phase Planning Optimization
```
Prompt: "Given my Agricola draft deck: [card list], create optimal play sequence for rounds 1-14. Consider resource constraints, timing windows, and scoring priorities. Include contingency plans."
```

### Dynamic Phase Adaptation
```
Prompt: "Current game state: Round [X], Resources: [list], Board state: [description]. My remaining cards: [list]. What's the optimal strategy for remaining rounds?"
```

### Opponent Analysis Integration
```
Prompt: "Opponent actions: [action history]. Their visible cards: [list]. How should I adjust my phase strategy to counter their likely gameplan?"
```

## ðŸ”§ Key Strategic Insights

### Phase Transition Mastery
- **Early to Mid**: Shift from foundation to scaling
- **Mid to Late**: Pivot from building to scoring
- **Timing Windows**: Recognize when phase changes occur
- **Opportunity Costs**: Understand when to pivot strategies

### Common Phase Mistakes
1. **Over-building Early**: Too much infrastructure, not enough scaling
2. **Late Engine Deployment**: Playing engines when no time for payoff
3. **Harvest Unpreparedness**: Insufficient food at harvest times
4. **Resource Hoarding**: Not converting materials to points late
5. **Action Inefficiency**: Wasting actions in critical phases

### Pro-Level Phase Management
- **Flexible Planning**: Adjust phase strategy based on board state
- **Opponent Timing**: Disrupt opponent phase transitions
- **Resource Smoothing**: Balance accumulation and spending
- **Critical Path Recognition**: Identify must-execute sequences
