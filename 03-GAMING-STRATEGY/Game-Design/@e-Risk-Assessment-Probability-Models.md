- Build predictive models for outcome forecasting and variance management

## üîß Core Probability Theory Applications

### Fundamental Probability Concepts
- **Expected Value Calculation**: EV = Œ£(Probability √ó Outcome Value)
- **Variance Assessment**: Risk measurement and uncertainty quantification
- **Conditional Probability**: P(A|B) outcomes based on observed information
- **Bayes' Theorem**: Prior belief updating with new evidence
- **Law of Large Numbers**: Long-term convergence and sample size effects

### Draft-Specific Probability Models
```
Card Availability Probability:
P(Card Available) = (Cards Remaining) / (Total Pool Size - Cards Seen)

Pack Wheel Probability:
P(Wheel) = P(7 players pass) = Œ†(P(Player i passes))

Archetype Completion Probability:
P(Viable Deck) = P(Key Cards) √ó P(Enablers) √ó P(Mana Base)
```

### Risk Classification System
- **Low Risk** (80%+ success): Safe, proven strategies with high consistency
- **Medium Risk** (60-80% success): Solid strategies with known failure modes
- **High Risk** (40-60% success): Speculative strategies requiring specific cards
- **Very High Risk** (20-40% success): Experimental strategies with major dependencies
- **Extreme Risk** (<20% success): Long-shot strategies with minimal viability

    def __init__(self, format_data, current_state):
        self.format_data = format_data
        self.current_picks = current_state['picks']
        self.available_cards = current_state['pool']
        
    def simulate_draft_completion(self, iterations=10000):
        results = []
        for _ in range(iterations):
            final_deck = self.complete_draft_randomly()
            win_rate = self.evaluate_deck_strength(final_deck)
            results.append(win_rate)

        lower = np.percentile(results, (alpha/2) * 100)
        upper = np.percentile(results, (1 - alpha/2) * 100)
        return lower, upper
```

### Decision Tree Analysis

## üéÆ Format-Specific Risk Models

### Magic: The Gathering Risk Assessment
```
Risk Factors:
- Color Commitment Risk: P(Mana Problems) based on fixing availability
- Archetype Risk: P(Strategy Fails) based on key card density
- Curve Risk: P(Mana Curve Issues) based on CMC distribution
- Power Level Risk: P(Deck Too Weak) based on card quality
- Synergy Risk: P(Synergies Don't Come Together) based on enabler count

Calculation Example:
Aggro Deck Risk = 1 - [P(Enough 1-2 drops) √ó P(Sufficient Reach) √ó P(No Color Issues)]
```

```
Strategic Risk Factors:

```

## üîç Advanced Risk Management Strategies

### Portfolio Theory Applications
- **Diversification**: Reducing correlation between draft picks
- **Risk-Return Optimization**: Efficient frontier for pick decisions
- **Correlation Analysis**: Understanding pick interdependencies
- **Systematic vs Idiosyncratic Risk**: Format-wide vs specific risks
- **Value at Risk (VaR)**: Worst-case scenario quantification

### Kelly Criterion for Draft Sizing
```
Kelly Formula: f* = (bp - q) / b
Where:
f* = fraction of "bankroll" to bet (pick commitment level)
b = odds received (payoff ratio)
p = probability of winning
q = probability of losing (1-p)

Draft Application:
Commitment Level = (Strategy_Upside √ó P(Success) - P(Failure)) / Strategy_Upside
```

### Options Theory in Drafting
- **Option Value**: Keeping strategic doors open
- **Exercise Price**: Cost of committing to strategy
- **Time Decay**: Decreasing flexibility over draft progression
- **Volatility**: Uncertainty about optimal strategy
- **Early Exercise**: When to commit vs maintain flexibility

    def assess_pick_risk(self, current_state, pick_options):
        risk_scores = {}
        for option in pick_options:
            expected_value = self.calculate_ev(option, current_state)
            variance = self.calculate_variance(option, current_state)
            risk_adjusted_value = expected_value - (self.risk_aversion * variance)
            risk_scores[option] = {
                'ev': expected_value,
                'variance': variance,
                'risk_adjusted': risk_adjusted_value,
