## üöÄ AI/LLM Integration Opportunities

### Draft Analysis Automation
```prompt
"Analyze this draft position: [pack contents], [previous picks], [signals received]. 
Recommend optimal pick with reasoning including:
- Tier evaluation of each option
- Archetype implications
- Signal considerations
- Risk/reward assessment
Format as structured decision matrix."
```

### Meta Analysis Systems
```prompt
"Process this draft format data: [recent results], [archetype performance], [card usage stats].
Generate meta analysis including:
- Tier list updates
- Archetype viability rankings
- Format speed assessment
- Counter-strategy recommendations
Create weekly meta report format."
```

### Training Simulation Prompts
```prompt
"Create draft training scenarios for [format]. Generate:
- 20 difficult pick decisions with context
- Varied archetype situations
- Signal reading exercises
- End-game draft decisions
Include solutions with detailed reasoning."
```
