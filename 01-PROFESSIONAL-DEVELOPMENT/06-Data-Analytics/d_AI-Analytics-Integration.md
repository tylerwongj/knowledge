### Machine Learning for Game Analytics
```csharp
// Unity ML-Agents for Player Behavior Analysis
public class PlayerBehaviorAnalyzer
{
    public void AnalyzePlayerPatterns()
    {
        // Collect player interaction data
        var playerData = CollectPlayerInteractions();
        
        // Apply ML model for pattern recognition
        var patterns = MLModel.PredictPlayerBehavior(playerData);
        
        // Generate actionable insights
        GenerateInsights(patterns);
    }
}
