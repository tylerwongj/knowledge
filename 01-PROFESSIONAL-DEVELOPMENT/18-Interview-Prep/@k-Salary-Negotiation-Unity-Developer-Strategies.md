## Negotiation Conversation Scripts

### Opening Compensation Discussion
"I'm very excited about this Unity developer opportunity and the chance to contribute to [specific project/game]. Based on my research and experience with Unity development, particularly in [specific area like VR/multiplayer/mobile], I believe the compensation package could be adjusted to better reflect the market value for someone with my specific skill set. Could we discuss the flexibility in the offer?"

### Salary Negotiation Script
"I've done extensive research on Unity developer compensation in [location], and based on platforms like Levels.fyi and Glassdoor, similar positions with my experience level are compensating in the range of $X to $Y. Given my specific expertise in [Unity specialization] and the impact I've demonstrated in previous roles, such as [specific achievement], I believe a base salary of $[target amount] would be more aligned with market rates."

### Equity Negotiation Approach
"I'm particularly interested in the long-term success of [company/game project]. In the gaming industry, I understand that equity can be a significant component of compensation. Could we explore increasing the equity grant to offset the gap in base salary? I'm committed to contributing to the company's growth and would like my compensation to reflect that long-term partnership."

### Benefits Enhancement Strategy
"Beyond base salary, I'd like to discuss some additional benefits that would be valuable for a Unity developer role:
- Additional PTO for attending Unity conferences and training (2-3 days/year)
- Professional development budget for Unity certifications and courses ($2,000/year)
- Home office stipend for development hardware upgrades ($1,500/year)
- Flexible work arrangements for optimal development productivity"
