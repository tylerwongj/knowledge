public class GlobalTeamUpdate
{
    public DateTime Timestamp { get; set; }
    public string TeamMember { get; set; }
    public string TimeZone { get; set; }
    public string WorkCompleted { get; set; }
    public string NextDayPlans { get; set; }
    public List<string> BlockersOrQuestions { get; set; }
    public CulturePreference CommunicationStyle { get; set; }
}
```

### Meeting Optimization Across Cultures

public class GlobalTeamCodeStandards
{
    // Clear, simple English comments for international teams
    // Avoid idioms, slang, or culturally-specific references
    // Include context for business logic decisions
    
    /// <summary>
    /// Calculates damage reduction based on armor value
    /// Formula: damage * (1 - armor / (armor + 100))
    /// Used in all combat systems - coordinate changes with all regions
    /// </summary>
    public float CalculateDamageReduction(float damage, float armor)
    {
        return damage * (1 - armor / (armor + 100));
    }
}
```

### Performance Optimization Coordination
- **Regional Device Considerations**: Mobile performance across markets
