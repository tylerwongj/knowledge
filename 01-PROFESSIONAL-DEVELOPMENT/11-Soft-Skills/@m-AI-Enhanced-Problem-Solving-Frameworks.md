```

### AI-Powered Root Cause Analysis
```csharp
// Example: Systematic debugging approach with AI assistance
public class ProblemSolvingFramework
{
    public enum ProblemType
    {
        Performance,
        Logic,
        Integration,
        UserExperience,
        Architecture
    }
    
    public class Problem
    {
        public string Description { get; set; }
        public ProblemType Type { get; set; }
        public List<string> Symptoms { get; set; } = new List<string>();
        public List<string> PotentialCauses { get; set; } = new List<string>();
        public List<string> AIGeneratedHypotheses { get; set; } = new List<string>();
    }
    
    public static List<string> GenerateAIPrompts(Problem problem)
    {
        var prompts = new List<string>();
        
        switch (problem.Type)
        {
            case ProblemType.Performance:
                prompts.Add($"Analyze Unity performance issue: {problem.Description}. List 10 potential causes.");
                prompts.Add($"Given symptoms: {string.Join(", ", problem.Symptoms)}, suggest profiling strategies.");
                break;
                
            case ProblemType.Logic:
                prompts.Add($"Debug logic error in Unity: {problem.Description}. Suggest debugging steps.");
                prompts.Add($"Review code logic and identify potential edge cases for: {problem.Description}");
                break;
        }
        
        return prompts;
    }
}
```

## üß† Systematic Debugging Methodology

### The 5 Whys Technique with AI Enhancement
```markdown
## Example: Unity Frame Rate Drop Analysis

**Problem**: Game drops to 30 FPS during combat sequences

**Why 1**: Why does frame rate drop during combat?
- AI Analysis: "Combat involves particle effects, multiple AI agents, physics calculations"

**Why 2**: Why do particle effects impact performance so heavily?
- AI Analysis: "Check for over-emission, lack of culling, inefficient shaders"

**Why 3**: Why aren't particle systems being culled properly?
- AI Analysis: "Investigate LOD settings, distance culling, occlusion culling setup"

**Why 4**: Why wasn't LOD implemented for particle systems?
- AI Analysis: "Review development process, technical debt, time constraints"

**Why 5**: Why wasn't performance planning integrated into development workflow?
- AI Analysis: "Suggest performance budgeting, regular profiling, automated testing"
```

### Decision Matrix Framework
```csharp
public class DecisionMatrix
{
    public class Criterion
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public float Weight { get; set; } // 0-1
        public string AIAnalysisPrompt { get; set; }
    }
    
    public class Alternative
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public Dictionary<string, float> Scores { get; set; } = new Dictionary<string, float>();
        public float WeightedScore { get; set; }
        public List<string> AIGeneratedProsAndCons { get; set; } = new List<string>();
    }
    
    public static Alternative AnalyzeDecision(List<Criterion> criteria, List<Alternative> alternatives)
    {
        foreach (var alternative in alternatives)
        {
            float totalScore = 0f;
            
            foreach (var criterion in criteria)
            {
                if (alternative.Scores.ContainsKey(criterion.Name))
                {
                    totalScore += alternative.Scores[criterion.Name] * criterion.Weight;
                }
            }
            
            alternative.WeightedScore = totalScore;
        }
        
        return alternatives.OrderByDescending(a => a.WeightedScore).First();
    }
}
```
