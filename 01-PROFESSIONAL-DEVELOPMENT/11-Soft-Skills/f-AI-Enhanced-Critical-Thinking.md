### AI-Powered Analysis Framework
```python
# Critical Thinking Enhancement System
class CriticalThinkingAI:
    def analyze_problem(self, problem_statement):
        decomposition = self.break_down_problem(problem_statement)
        assumptions = self.identify_assumptions(decomposition)
        biases = self.detect_cognitive_biases(assumptions)
        evidence = self.gather_supporting_evidence()
        
        return self.synthesize_analysis(decomposition, assumptions, biases, evidence)
        
    def evaluate_arguments(self, argument_chain):
        logical_structure = self.map_argument_flow(argument_chain)
        fallacies = self.identify_logical_fallacies(logical_structure)
        evidence_quality = self.assess_evidence_strength()
        return self.generate_critique(logical_structure, fallacies, evidence_quality)

### Systematic Bias Detection
```markdown
# Cognitive Bias Recognition System

## Common Bias Patterns
- Confirmation bias in information gathering
- Anchoring bias in initial assumptions
- Availability heuristic in probability estimation
- Survivorship bias in success analysis

## AI-Assisted Bias Mitigation
1. Devil's advocate argument generation
2. Alternative perspective simulation
3. Base rate statistical analysis
4. Historical precedent examination
```

### Decision-Making Optimization
- Multi-criteria decision analysis with AI weighting
- Scenario planning with probability modeling
- Risk assessment with Monte Carlo simulations
- Option value analysis for timing decisions

## ðŸš€ AI/LLM Integration Opportunities

### Problem Analysis Prompts
```
"Analyze this complex problem systematically:
1. Break down into component sub-problems
2. Identify underlying assumptions and biases
3. Generate alternative perspectives and approaches
4. Assess evidence quality and information gaps
5. Recommend structured decision-making process"
```

### Argument Evaluation Prompts
```
"Evaluate this argument for logical soundness:
- Map the logical structure and reasoning chain
- Identify potential logical fallacies or weak points
- Assess the quality and relevance of evidence
- Generate counter-arguments and rebuttals
- Provide objective strength assessment"
```
