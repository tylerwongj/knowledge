```

**Unity Application Example:**
```csharp
// Technical Architecture Decision Framework
public class TechnicalDecisionMatrix
{
    public struct DecisionCriteria
    {
        public float performance;      // 0-10 scale
        public float maintainability;  // 0-10 scale
        public float scalability;      // 0-10 scale
        public float teamFamiliarity;  // 0-10 scale
        public float developmentTime;  // 0-10 scale (inverted - less is better)
        public float riskLevel;        // 0-10 scale (inverted - less is better)
    }
    
    public static float CalculateDecisionScore(DecisionCriteria criteria, 
                                             DecisionWeights weights)
    {
        return (criteria.performance * weights.performanceWeight +
                criteria.maintainability * weights.maintainabilityWeight +
                criteria.scalability * weights.scalabilityWeight +
                criteria.teamFamiliarity * weights.familiarityWeight +
                (10f - criteria.developmentTime) * weights.timeWeight +
                (10f - criteria.riskLevel) * weights.riskWeight) / 6f;
    }
}
```

}

public class TaskPrioritizer
{
    public static TaskPriority EvaluateTask(bool isUrgent, bool isImportant)
    {
        if (isUrgent && isImportant) return TaskPriority.UrgentImportant;
        if (!isUrgent && isImportant) return TaskPriority.NotUrgentImportant;
        if (isUrgent && !isImportant) return TaskPriority.UrgentNotImportant;
        return TaskPriority.NotUrgentNotImportant;
    }
}
```

## 🚀 AI-Enhanced Decision Making

### Automated Technical Analysis
```csharp
// AI-Assisted Architecture Decision Support
public class AIDecisionSupport
{
    public async Task<ArchitectureRecommendation> AnalyzeArchitectureOptions(
        List<ArchitectureOption> options,
        ProjectConstraints constraints)
    {
        var analysisPrompt = $@"
        Analyze these Unity architecture options for a {constraints.projectType} game:
        Team size: {constraints.teamSize}
        Timeline: {constraints.timeline}
        Platform targets: {string.Join(", ", constraints.platforms)}
        
        Options:
        {string.Join("\n", options.Select(o => $"- {o.name}: {o.description}"))}
        
        Provide detailed analysis with:
        1. Technical pros/cons for each option
        2. Risk assessment (1-10 scale)
        3. Development time estimates
        4. Team learning curve considerations
        5. Recommended choice with justification
        ";

            .OrderByDescending(s => s.Score / (s.RiskFactor * s.TimeEstimate))
            .ToList();
            
        return new DecisionRecommendation
        {
            PrimaryRecommendation = scoredStrategies.First().Strategy,
            AlternativeOptions = scoredStrategies.Skip(1).Take(2).Select(s => s.Strategy).ToList(),
            ConfidenceLevel = CalculateConfidence(scoredStrategies),
            RiskAssessment = AssessOverallRisk(scoredStrategies.First())

{
    public async Task<ConsensusDecision> FacilitateTeamDecision(
        DecisionContext context,
        List<TeamMember> stakeholders)
    {
        // 1. Problem framing phase
        var problemDefinition = await GatherStakeholderInput(context, stakeholders);
        
        // 2. Solution generation phase
        var solutions = await GenerateSolutions(problemDefinition, stakeholders);
        
        // 3. Evaluation phase
        var evaluations = await EvaluateSolutions(solutions, stakeholders);
        
        // 4. Consensus building phase
        var consensus = await BuildConsensus(evaluations, stakeholders);
        
        // 5. Implementation planning phase
        var implementationPlan = await CreateImplementationPlan(consensus);
        
        return new ConsensusDecision
        {
            ChosenSolution = consensus.selectedSolution,
            StakeholderBuyIn = consensus.agreementLevel,
            ImplementationPlan = implementationPlan,
            SuccessMetrics = DefineSuccessMetrics(consensus.selectedSolution)
        };
    }
}
```
