## 🔧 Technical Unity Questions

### Core Unity Architecture
**Q: Explain Unity's GameObject-Component architecture.**
```csharp
// Demonstrate understanding with code
public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour 
{
    private Rigidbody rb;
    private Collider playerCollider;
    
    void Awake() {
        // Get components attached to this GameObject
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
        playerCollider = GetComponent<Collider>();
    }
}
```

**Key Points:**
- Composition over inheritance
- Modular, reusable systems
- Component communication patterns

### Performance Optimization
**Q: How do you optimize Unity performance?**

**Memory Management:**
- Object pooling for frequently instantiated objects
- Proper texture compression and LOD systems
- Efficient garbage collection practices

```csharp
// Object Pool Example
public class ObjectPool : MonoBehaviour 
{
    public Queue<GameObject> pooledObjects = new Queue<GameObject>();
    public GameObject objectPrefab;
    public int poolSize = 20;
    
    void Start() {
        for (int i = 0; i < poolSize; i++) {
            GameObject obj = Instantiate(objectPrefab);
            obj.SetActive(false);
            pooledObjects.Enqueue(obj);
        }
    }
    
    public GameObject GetPooledObject() {
        if (pooledObjects.Count > 0) {
            GameObject obj = pooledObjects.Dequeue();
            obj.SetActive(true);
            return obj;
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

### Scripting Fundamentals
**Q: Difference between Update, FixedUpdate, and LateUpdate?**
- **Update()**: Frame-rate dependent, UI updates, input handling
- **FixedUpdate()**: Fixed timestep, physics calculations
- **LateUpdate()**: After all Updates, camera following logic

### Unity-Specific C# Questions
**Q: How do you handle null reference exceptions with Unity objects?**
```csharp
// Safe null checking
if (gameObject != null && gameObject.activeInHierarchy) {
    // Safe to use gameObject
}

// Null-conditional operator
transform?.Translate(Vector3.forward);
```

## 🎮 Practical Coding Challenges

### Challenge 1: Player Movement System
```csharp
public class PlayerMovement : MonoBehaviour 
{
    [SerializeField] private float moveSpeed = 5f;
    [SerializeField] private float jumpForce = 10f;
    private Rigidbody rb;
    private bool isGrounded;
    
    void Start() {
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
    }
    
    void Update() {
        HandleMovement();
        HandleJumping();
    }
    
    private void HandleMovement() {
        float horizontal = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
        float vertical = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");
        
        Vector3 movement = new Vector3(horizontal, 0f, vertical) * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime;
        transform.Translate(movement, Space.World);
    }
    
    private void HandleJumping() {
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space) && isGrounded) {
            rb.AddForce(Vector3.up * jumpForce, ForceMode.Impulse);
            isGrounded = false;
        }
    }
    
    private void OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision) {
        if (collision.gameObject.CompareTag("Ground")) {
            isGrounded = true;
        }
    }
}
```

### Challenge 2: Singleton Manager Pattern
```csharp
public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour 
{
    public static GameManager Instance { get; private set; }
    
    [SerializeField] private int playerScore = 0;
    [SerializeField] private bool gameIsPaused = false;
    
    void Awake() {
        if (Instance != null && Instance != this) {
            Destroy(this);
            return;
        }
        Instance = this;
        DontDestroyOnLoad(this);
    }
    
    public void AddScore(int points) {
        playerScore += points;
        // Trigger UI update or other systems
    }
    
    public void PauseGame() {
        gameIsPaused = !gameIsPaused;
        Time.timeScale = gameIsPaused ? 0f : 1f;
    }
}
```

### Challenge 3: Object Interaction System
```csharp
public interface IInteractable 
{
    void Interact(GameObject interactor);
    string GetInteractionPrompt();
}

public class Door : MonoBehaviour, IInteractable 
{
    [SerializeField] private bool isOpen = false;
    [SerializeField] private Animator doorAnimator;
    
    public void Interact(GameObject interactor) {
        ToggleDoor();
    }
    
    public string GetInteractionPrompt() {
        return isOpen ? "Close Door" : "Open Door";
    }
    
    private void ToggleDoor() {
        isOpen = !isOpen;
        doorAnimator.SetBool("IsOpen", isOpen);
    }
}
```

## 🧠 Behavioral Questions & STAR Method

### Common Behavioral Questions

**Q: "Tell me about a challenging Unity project you worked on."**

**STAR Framework Response:**
- **Situation**: Describe the project context
- **Task**: Explain your specific responsibilities
- **Action**: Detail the steps you took
- **Result**: Share the outcome and lessons learned

**Example Response:**
"I worked on a mobile puzzle game where we needed to optimize performance for older devices (Situation). My task was to reduce memory usage by 40% while maintaining visual quality (Task). I implemented object pooling for UI elements, optimized texture compression, and restructured the scene hierarchy to reduce draw calls (Action). We achieved a 45% memory reduction and improved frame rate from 25fps to 45fps on target devices (Result)."

### Technical Leadership Questions
**Q: "How do you handle code reviews and maintain code quality?"**
