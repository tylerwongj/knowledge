# m_Scripting Architecture Patterns

## üéØ Learning Objectives
- Master common Unity architectural patterns for scalable game development
- Understand when and how to implement different design patterns
- Learn to structure code for maintainability and team collaboration
- Develop skills for managing complex game systems and interactions

## üîß Core Architectural Patterns

### Model-View-Controller (MVC)
- **Model**: Game data and business logic
- **View**: UI and visual representation
- **Controller**: Input handling and user interactions
- Unity Implementation: ScriptableObjects for models, MonoBehaviours for views/controllers

### Component-Based Architecture
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component handles one specific concern
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Building complex behaviors through component combinations
- **Loose Coupling**: Components communicate through events or interfaces
- **Reusability**: Components can be mixed and matched across different GameObjects

### Event-Driven Architecture
- **UnityEvents**: Inspector-assignable event callbacks
- **C# Events**: Type-safe publisher-subscriber pattern
- **Action/Func Delegates**: Lightweight callback mechanisms
- **Message Systems**: Centralized communication hubs

### Service Locator Pattern
- **Singleton Services**: Global access to core game systems
- **Service Registration**: Runtime discovery of available services
- **Dependency Injection**: Providing dependencies rather than services finding them
- **Interface Segregation**: Services accessed through specific interfaces

## üèóÔ∏è Unity-Specific Patterns

### ScriptableObject Architecture
- **Data Containers**: Configuration and content storage
- **Event Systems**: ScriptableObject-based event channels
- **Variable References**: Shared data between systems
- **Runtime Sets**: Dynamic collections of game objects

### MonoBehaviour Patterns
- **Initialization Order**: Awake vs Start vs OnEnable timing
- **Component Communication**: GetComponent vs direct references
- **Lifecycle Management**: Proper cleanup in OnDestroy
- **Coroutine Management**: Starting and stopping coroutines properly

### State Machine Patterns
- **FSM Implementation**: Finite state machines for game objects
- **Behavior Trees**: Complex AI decision-making structures
- **Animation State Machines**: Mecanim integration patterns
- **Game State Management**: High-level application state control

### Observer Pattern Variations
- **Unity Events**: Inspector-configurable event connections
- **Static Events**: Global event broadcasting
- **Interface-Based Events**: Type-safe event handling
- **Event Channels**: ScriptableObject event distribution

## üéÆ Game-Specific Architectures

### Player Controller Patterns
- **Input Handling**: Separating input detection from action execution
- **Movement Systems**: Physics-based vs transform-based movement
- **Animation Integration**: Connecting input to animation systems
- **State Management**: Player state transitions and behavior

### UI Architecture Patterns
- **MVVM for UI**: Model-View-ViewModel pattern in Unity UI
- **UI State Management**: Handling complex UI state transitions
- **Data Binding**: Connecting UI elements to data sources
- **Command Pattern**: Decoupling UI actions from game logic

### Save System Patterns
- **Serialization Strategies**: JSON, Binary, ScriptableObjects
- **Save State Management**: What to save and when
- **Version Compatibility**: Handling save file format changes
- **Cloud Save Integration**: Local and remote save synchronization

### Audio Architecture
- **Audio Manager Patterns**: Centralized sound management
- **Audio Pooling**: Efficient AudioSource management
- **Dynamic Music**: Adaptive and interactive audio systems
- **3D Audio Integration**: Spatial audio and environmental effects

## üöÄ AI/LLM Integration Opportunities

### Architecture Planning
- Generate architectural diagrams and class relationship maps
- Create code structure templates for common Unity patterns
- Develop architecture review checklists and best practices
- Automate documentation generation for architectural decisions

### Code Generation
- Generate boilerplate code for common patterns (Singleton, Observer, etc.)
- Create interface definitions and implementation templates
- Develop unit test templates for architectural components
- Automate refactoring suggestions for architectural improvements

### Performance Analysis
- Generate performance analysis reports for different architectural choices
- Create optimization recommendations based on profiling data
- Develop scaling analysis for different architectural patterns
- Automate code review for architectural consistency

## üí° Key Highlights

- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic patterns and add complexity as needed
- **Consistency**: Maintain architectural consistency across the project
- **Team Alignment**: Ensure all team members understand chosen patterns
- **Performance Awareness**: Consider performance implications of architectural choices
- **Evolution**: Be prepared to refactor architecture as project requirements change
