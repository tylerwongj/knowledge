# c_CI-CD-Testing-Automation - Continuous Integration & Deployment Testing

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for Unity projects
- Automate testing in build processes
- Set up automated deployment workflows
- Create comprehensive testing gates for releases

## ðŸ”§ CI/CD Testing Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Unity Testing
```yaml
# .github/workflows/unity-tests.yml
name: Unity CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    
    - uses: game-ci/unity-test-runner@v2
      with:
        projectPath: .
        testMode: all
        artifactsPath: test-results
        
    - name: Upload Test Results
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: Test results
        path: test-results
```

### Automated Build Testing
```csharp
// Custom Build Testing Scripts
public class BuildAutomation
{
    [MenuItem("Build/Run All Tests and Build")]
    public static void RunTestsAndBuild()
    {
        // Run all tests first
        var testRunner = EditorWindow.GetWindow<TestRunnerWindow>();
        testRunner.RunAllTests();
        
        // Only build if tests pass
        if (AllTestsPassed())
        {
            BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer(GetBuildSettings());
        }
    }
}
```

## ðŸš€ AI/LLM Integration Opportunities

### AI-Enhanced CI/CD
- **Smart Testing**: AI-determined optimal test selection
- **Failure Analysis**: Automated root cause analysis for failed builds
- **Performance Monitoring**: AI-driven performance regression detection
- **Deployment Decisions**: AI-assisted go/no-go deployment decisions

### CI/CD Automation Prompts
```
"Create a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow for Unity that runs tests, builds for multiple platforms, and deploys automatically"

"Generate automated testing scripts that run before each Unity build and block deployment if critical tests fail"

"Design a CI/CD pipeline that uses AI to determine which tests to run based on code changes"
```

## ðŸ’¡ Key Highlights
- **Automated Gates**: Testing checkpoints that prevent bad deployments
- **Multi-Platform Builds**: Automated builds for all target platforms
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous performance regression detection
- **Rollback Automation**: Automated rollback on deployment failures
