# @e-Technical-Writing-Standards

## üéØ Learning Objectives
- Master professional technical writing standards for software documentation
- Develop clear, concise communication skills essential for Unity development teams
- Implement writing workflows that scale with project complexity and team size
- Create technical content that serves both novice and expert developers effectively

## üîß Core Technical Writing Principles

### The Hierarchy of Technical Communication
1. **Clarity**: Information is immediately understandable
2. **Accuracy**: Technical details are precise and current
3. **Completeness**: All necessary information is included
4. **Conciseness**: No unnecessary words or complexity
5. **Consistency**: Terminology and style remain uniform

### Unity-Specific Writing Standards
```markdown
# Writing Style Guide for Unity Documentation

## Terminology Consistency
- **GameObject** (not game object or Game Object)
- **MonoBehaviour** (not Monobehavior or MonoBehavior)
- **Inspector** (capitalized when referring to Unity's Inspector window)
- **Scene** vs **scene** (capitalized for Unity Scene asset, lowercase for general concept)

## Code Integration Standards
- Always provide context before code examples
- Include expected outcomes after code blocks
- Use proper syntax highlighting: ```csharp
- Explain non-obvious Unity-specific behavior

## Structure Templates
### Method Documentation
**Purpose**: One-line description of what this method accomplishes
**Parameters**: List each parameter with type and constraints
**Returns**: Describe return value and possible states
**Example**: Practical usage in Unity context
**Notes**: Performance implications, Unity-specific behavior

### System Documentation
**Overview**: High-level description of system purpose
**Components**: List of related scripts and their roles
**Dependencies**: Required Unity components and other systems
**Setup**: Step-by-step implementation instructions
**Integration**: How this connects with other game systems
```

### Professional Writing Patterns
```markdown
# ‚úÖ GOOD: Clear, actionable, specific
## Setting Up Player Movement
Configure the PlayerController component to handle input and physics-based movement:

1. Attach PlayerController script to your player GameObject
2. Assign the CharacterController component (auto-assigned if not present)
3. Set moveSpeed to 5.0f for standard walking pace
4. Configure inputActions asset in the Input Actions field

The system uses Unity's Input System and requires the InputSystem package.

# ‚ùå BAD: Vague, assumes knowledge, incomplete
## Player Stuff
Add the script and set it up. Make sure you have the right components.
Configure the settings as needed for your game.
```

    - Technical details that need clarification
    """
    return ai_client.analyze(prompt)
```

### Style Consistency Automation
- **Terminology validation**: Ensure consistent use of Unity-specific terms
- **Voice and tone checking**: Maintain professional but accessible writing style
- **Structure verification**: Validate against established templates and patterns
- **Cross-reference validation**: Check that referenced systems and components exist

## üí° Advanced Writing Techniques

### Progressive Disclosure Method
```markdown
# Player Movement System

## Quick Start (30 seconds)
1. Add PlayerController script to player GameObject
2. Press Play - character moves with WASD keys
3. Adjust moveSpeed in Inspector for different feel

## Detailed Configuration (5 minutes)
### Input Setup
The PlayerController uses Unity's Input System for cross-platform compatibility:
- **Keyboard**: WASD for movement, Space for jump
- **Gamepad**: Left stick for movement, South button for jump
- **Touch**: Virtual joystick (mobile builds only)

### Physics Configuration
Movement uses CharacterController for consistent collision detection:
```csharp
// Core movement implementation
private void MovePlayer(Vector3 moveDirection)
{
    // Apply gravity when not grounded
    if (!controller.isGrounded)
    {
        velocity.y += gravity * Time.deltaTime;
    }
    
    // Combine horizontal movement with vertical velocity
    Vector3 finalMovement = moveDirection + Vector3.up * velocity.y;
    controller.Move(finalMovement * Time.deltaTime);
}
```

## Advanced Customization (15 minutes)
[Detailed customization options for experienced developers]
```

### Audience-Specific Writing
```markdown
# For Unity Beginners
## Adding Player Movement to Your Game
Player movement is how your character responds to input and moves around the game world. 

**What you'll learn**: How to make a character move smoothly using Unity's built-in physics system.

**Prerequisites**: 
- Basic familiarity with Unity Interface
- Understanding of GameObjects and Components
- Completed Unity Learn's "Create with Code" course (recommended)

# For Experienced Developers
## PlayerController Architecture Implementation
Implements command pattern with input abstraction layer for cross-platform compatibility.

**Technical Overview**: CharacterController-based movement with customizable physics parameters, event-driven state management, and optimized input polling.

**Integration Points**:
- IInputProvider interface for input system abstraction
- Event-driven communication with animation and audio systems
- Performance profiling hooks for mobile optimization
```

### Error Prevention Writing
```markdown
# Common Implementation Pitfalls

## ‚ùå Incorrect: Direct Transform Manipulation
```csharp
// DON'T DO THIS - bypasses Unity's physics system
transform.position += moveDirection * speed * Time.deltaTime;
```
**Problem**: Ignores collisions, causes physics inconsistencies
**Result**: Player can move through walls, fall through floors

## ‚úÖ Correct: CharacterController Integration
```csharp
// Proper physics-based movement
characterController.Move(moveDirection * speed * Time.deltaTime);
```
**Benefits**: Respects collisions, integrates with Unity's physics
**Performance**: Optimized collision detection, stable on all platforms
```

**Dependents**: Systems that rely on this one
**Performance Profile**: Resource usage characteristics

## Component Relationships
```
[System Diagram - ASCII or link to image]
PlayerController
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ InputHandler (processes raw input)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MovementProcessor (calculates movement)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PhysicsApplier (applies to CharacterController)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ EventPublisher (notifies other systems)
```

## Data Flow
1. **Input Collection**: Raw input gathered from multiple sources
2. **Input Processing**: Normalized to movement vectors
3. **Physics Application**: Applied through Unity's CharacterController
4. **State Broadcasting**: Movement events published for other systems

## Extension Points
- **IInputProvider**: Custom input sources (AI, replay, etc.)
- **IMovementModifier**: Effects that alter movement (speed boosts, etc.)
- **IMovementValidator**: Constraints on movement (bounds checking, etc.)

## Performance Optimization
- Input polling limited to 60Hz for mobile battery life
- Movement calculations vectorized for SIMD optimization
- Event publishing uses object pooling to reduce GC pressure
```
