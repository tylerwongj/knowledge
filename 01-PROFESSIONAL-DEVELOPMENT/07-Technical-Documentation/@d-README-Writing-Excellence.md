## 🚀 Quick Start (2 Minutes)

```bash
# Prerequisites: Unity Hub installed
git clone https://github.com/username/project-name.git
cd project-name

# Open in Unity Hub
# 1. Add Project -> Select folder
# 2. Unity will import and compile automatically
# 3. Open SampleScene and press Play
```

```

### Performance Features
- **Object Pooling**: 95% reduction in garbage collection
- **LOD System**: Automatic quality scaling based on distance
- **Async Loading**: Non-blocking scene transitions
- **Texture Streaming**: Memory optimization for large worlds

## 📋 Development Setup

### Requirements
- **Unity**: 2023.3.0f1 LTS
- **Visual Studio**: 2022 or VS Code with C# extension
- **Git LFS**: Enabled for binary assets
- **Platform SDKs**: Android/iOS for mobile builds

### Project Configuration
```csharp
// Key project settings
PlayerSettings.colorSpace = ColorSpace.Linear;
PlayerSettings.apiCompatibilityLevel = ApiCompatibilityLevel.NET_Standard_2_1;
QualitySettings.vSyncCount = 1; // Target 60fps
```

### Development Workflow
1. **Branch Strategy**: `feature/system-name` from `develop`
2. **Code Standards**: XML documentation required for public APIs
3. **Testing**: Unit tests for core systems, integration tests for gameplay
4. **Performance**: Profiler checks before PR submission

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Basic Player Movement
```csharp
// Get player reference
var player = FindObjectOfType<PlayerController>();

// Move to position with smooth interpolation
player.MoveTo(targetPosition, duration: 2.0f);

// Listen for movement events
player.OnMovementComplete += HandleMovementFinished;
```

### Custom Enemy AI
```csharp
// Create new AI behavior
public class CustomEnemyBehavior : EnemyBehaviorBase
{
    public override BehaviorResult Execute(EnemyAI ai)
    {
        // Custom logic here
        return BehaviorResult.Success;
    }
}
```

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Graphics Settings
```json
{
  "renderPipeline": "URP",
  "shadowQuality": "High",
  "antiAliasing": "MSAA_4x",
  "textureQuality": "Full",
  "vsync": true
}
```

### Audio Configuration
```csharp
// Audio mixer groups
public enum AudioMixerGroup
{
    Master,     // Overall volume control
    Music,      // Background music and ambience
    SFX,        // Sound effects and UI
    Voice       // Character dialogue and narration
}
```
