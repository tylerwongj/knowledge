### AI-Enhanced Product Strategy
```python
# Product Intelligence System
class ProductAI:
    def analyze_market_opportunity(self, product_concept):
        market_size = self.research_tam_sam_som(product_concept)
        competitive_landscape = self.analyze_competitors()
        user_needs = self.process_user_research()
        technical_feasibility = self.assess_implementation_complexity()
        
        return self.generate_opportunity_assessment(
            market_size, competitive_landscape, user_needs, technical_feasibility
        )
        
    def create_product_roadmap(self, business_goals, technical_constraints):
        features = self.prioritize_features(business_goals)
        timeline = self.estimate_development_cycles(technical_constraints)
        return self.optimize_roadmap(features, timeline)
```
