### Contract Template Generation
```markdown
# AI-Generated Contract Templates

## Standard Service Agreement Template
- Scope of work automation based on project type
- Dynamic pricing calculations with AI recommendations
- Automatic timeline generation based on complexity
- Risk assessment and mitigation clauses

## Key Automation Points:
1. Project scope extraction from client brief
2. Pricing model selection (fixed/hourly/milestone)
3. Timeline estimation using historical data
4. Legal clause insertion based on project risk
```

### Proposal Automation System
```python
# Pseudo-code for AI Proposal Generation
class ProposalGenerator:
    def generate_proposal(self, client_brief, project_type):
        # AI analysis of client requirements
        scope = self.extract_scope(client_brief)
        timeline = self.estimate_timeline(scope, project_type)
        pricing = self.calculate_pricing(scope, timeline)
        
        return self.compile_proposal(scope, timeline, pricing)
```

### Client Communication Automation
- Automated follow-up sequences
- Progress update generation
- Meeting scheduling and reminder systems
- Client feedback collection and analysis
