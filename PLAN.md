## MAIN GOAL FOR THIS REPO:
- For this project, we want to generate a ton of markdown files so that we can view them in Obsidian and get a HUGE KNOWLEDGEBASE of information for everything that we can generate markdown files by using claude code cli to help us with

## Big Goals:
- 1. IF there is any work I can do that utilizes LLMs and AI so that I can make a difference for others.  If there are jobs that are involved with that I would love to learn more in those areas - I want to basically use programming to do those jobs that normal people do, but not reveal I use programming, since I liked to be 10x productive as the normal person.
- 2. IF I cannot find any of those jobs, then get a Unity Developer Job
- 3. Become the best Programmer using LLMs and AI Tools

## Possible Areas that can be automated quickly with LLMs and AI:
- Data Entry
- Web Development (simple static sites)
- Other stuff?

## Example Topics:
- Unity
- CSharp
- Soft Skills
- Resume Creation
- Job Sites
- etc.

## Prompt #1
- Please come up with a bunch of topics (not just the ones I have above) that pertain to my goals.  Those topics then should be able to generate a bunch of markdown files that pertain to those topics.  You should generate those markdown files.  
- Then I want to be able to go over the markdown files, highlight the information that is important, so I can retain such knowledge and use it to accomplish my goals.
