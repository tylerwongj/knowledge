## üîß Codec Selection Guide

### H.264/AVC
```yaml
Use Cases: Web streaming, social media, general distribution
Advantages: Wide compatibility, good compression
Disadvantages: Limited color depth, CPU intensive encoding
Best For: YouTube, Vimeo, corporate distribution
```

### H.265/HEVC
```yaml
Use Cases: 4K streaming, modern platforms with HEVC support
Advantages: Better compression than H.264, supports HDR
Disadvantages: Limited compatibility, newer codec
Best For: 4K content, bandwidth-limited streaming
```

### ProRes Family
```yaml
ProRes 422 Proxy: Editing proxies and rough cuts
ProRes 422 LT: Standard post-production workflow
ProRes 422: Broadcast and professional distribution
ProRes 422 HQ: High-quality mastering and archival
ProRes 4444: Alpha channel and highest quality
```

### DNxHD/DNxHR
```yaml
DNxHD: HD resolutions with various bitrate options
DNxHR: UHD/4K resolutions with scalable quality
Advantages: Avid compatibility, professional quality
Best For: Broadcast workflows and professional exchange
```

## üìä Quality Control and Optimization

### Technical QC Checklist
```yaml
Video Quality:
  - No dropped frames or rendering artifacts
  - Consistent color throughout timeline
  - Proper aspect ratio and resolution
  - Frame rate consistency
  - No interlacing issues on progressive content

Audio Quality:
  - Levels within broadcast standards (-23 LUFS)
  - No clipping or distortion
  - Sync accuracy with video
  - Consistent levels across entire program
  - Proper channel mapping for surround sound
```

### Bitrate Optimization
```yaml
Constant Bitrate (CBR): Predictable file sizes, broadcast use
Variable Bitrate (VBR): Optimized quality/size ratio
Average Bitrate (ABR): Balance between CBR and VBR
Quality-Based VBR: Maintain visual quality over bitrate
```

### Two-Pass Encoding
- **Analysis Pass**: Examines entire video for optimal encoding
- **Encoding Pass**: Creates final file with optimized settings
- **Benefits**: Better quality at same bitrate, more efficient compression
- **Trade-off**: Longer render times for improved quality

## üéØ Advanced Export Techniques

### Batch Export Workflows
```yaml
Multiple Format Export: Single timeline to multiple formats
Queue Management: Prioritize exports based on deadlines
Overnight Rendering: Schedule complex exports during off-hours
Network Rendering: Distribute processing across multiple machines
```

### Custom Export Presets
```yaml
Preset Creation: Save frequently used settings
Organization: Group presets by client or platform
Sharing: Export presets for team consistency
Version Control: Update presets for changing requirements
```

### Proxy and Deliverable Relationships
- **Proxy Workflow**: Edit with low-res, deliver with high-res
- **Media Relinking**: Automatically connect to high-resolution sources
- **Quality Verification**: Compare proxy edits to final renders
- **Conforming**: Ensure edit decisions transfer correctly
