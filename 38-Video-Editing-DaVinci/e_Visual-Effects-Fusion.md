```

## üé® Motion Graphics Creation

### Text and Title Design
```yaml
Text Node: Basic text creation and formatting

```

## üîß Advanced VFX Techniques

### Keying and Compositing
```yaml
Chroma Key: Green/blue screen removal
Luminance Key: Brightness-based transparency
Difference Key: Motion-based isolation
Garbage Mattes: Manual cleanup masks
Edge Cleanup: Refining key edges and spill removal
```

### Tracking and Stabilization
```yaml
2D Tracking: Following objects in 2D space
3D Camera Tracking: Reconstructing camera movement
Stabilization: Removing unwanted camera shake
Match Moving: Integrating 3D elements with footage
Planar Tracking: Tracking flat surfaces for replacement
```

### Particle Systems
- **Emitters**: Particle generation sources
- **Forces**: Gravity, wind, and turbulence effects
