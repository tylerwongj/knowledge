Bin Level: Organized media folders within project
```

### Naming Conventions
```yaml
Projects: "YYYYMMDD_ClientName_ProjectTitle_v01"
Timelines: "MainEdit_v01", "RoughCut_v02", "FinalMix_v03"
Bins: "01_RawFootage", "02_Interviews", "03_Broll", "04_Graphics"
Clips: "Scene01_Take03_CamA", "Interview_JohnDoe_MediumShot"
```

## ü§ù Collaborative Workflows

### Multi-User Collaboration Setup
```yaml
Database Server: Centralized PostgreSQL database
User Management: Individual login credentials and permissions
Project Locking: Prevent conflicts during editing
Real-time Sync: Live updates across user sessions
```

### Role-Based Collaboration
```yaml
Editor: Primary timeline assembly and story structure
Colorist: Color correction and grading
Audio Engineer: Fairlight mixing and sound design
VFX Artist: Fusion compositing and motion graphics
Producer: Review, notes, and approval workflow
```

### Version Control Strategies
- **Timeline Versions**: Save major edit milestones as new timelines
- **Project Snapshots**: Complete project state backups
- **Media Versioning**: Track updated assets and revisions  
- **Review Cycles**: Organized feedback and revision tracking
- **Final Lock**: Protected versions of completed work

## üíæ Media Management Best Practices

### File Organization
```yaml
Project Root Folder:
  üìÅ 01_Raw_Media
    üìÅ Video_Files
    üìÅ Audio_Files  
    üìÅ Graphics_Assets
  üìÅ 02_Project_Files
    üìÅ DaVinci_Projects
    üìÅ Export_Versions
  üìÅ 03_Archive
    üìÅ Original_Backups
    üìÅ Final_Deliverables
```

### Storage Strategy
```yaml
Active Storage: Fast SSD for current project work
Archive Storage: Large capacity HDD for completed projects
Backup Storage: Redundant copies in separate locations
Cloud Storage: Remote backup and collaboration access
```

### Media Optimization
- **Proxy Media**: Optimized files for smooth editing
- **Cache Management**: Strategic cache location and cleanup
- **Transcoding**: Convert incompatible formats during import
- **Media Pooling**: Centralized asset libraries for reuse
- **Offline Media**: Workflow for missing or moved files
