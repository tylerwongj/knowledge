```

## üöÄ AI/LLM Integration Opportunities

### UI System Architecture Planning
```prompt
Design a comprehensive UI architecture for my Unity game:

Game Details:
- Genre: [Specific game type and mechanics]
- Platform: [Mobile, PC, Console, or multi-platform]
- Art Style: [Visual aesthetic and mood]
- Target Audience: [Age group, gaming experience level]

Create:
1. Complete UI flow diagram with all screens
2. Component hierarchy and reusable elements
3. Leonardo AI prompts for each UI category
4. Unity Canvas setup recommendations
5. Responsive design guidelines for multiple screen sizes
6. Accessibility considerations and implementations
```

### Style Guide Development
```prompt
Create a comprehensive UI style guide for consistent Leonardo AI generation:

Brand Identity:
- Game Theme: [Setting, mood, genre expectations]
- Color Psychology: [How colors support gameplay emotions]
- Typography Needs: [Readability, personality, technical constraints]
- Visual Hierarchy: [Primary, secondary, tertiary element treatment]

Technical Constraints:
- Platform Requirements: [iOS, Android, Steam, Console guidelines]
- Performance Budgets: [Texture memory, draw call limits]
- Unity Integration: [Canvas scaling, sprite settings, animation systems]

Generate:
1. Master UI style definition for Leonardo AI
2. Component-specific prompt templates
3. Quality control checklist for generated assets
4. Integration workflow from Leonardo to Unity
```

### Automated UI Asset Pipeline
```prompt
Design an automated workflow for UI asset creation and integration:

Current Workflow Challenges:
- Inconsistent styling across UI elements
- Manual resizing and optimization for multiple platforms
- Time-consuming iteration cycles
- Unity integration bottlenecks

Optimize:
1. Leonardo AI batch generation strategies
2. Post-processing automation for Unity optimization
3. Version control for UI asset iterations
4. Quality assurance checkpoints
5. Performance testing integration
6. Cross-platform compatibility validation
```

## üí° Key Highlights

### Unity UI System Integration
```markdown
Unity Canvas Optimization:
- **Screen Space Overlay**: Main menus, pause screens, HUD elements
- **Screen Space Camera**: 3D integrated UI, depth-aware interfaces
- **World Space**: In-game signs, floating health bars, interaction prompts

9-Slice Sprite Setup:
- Border Definition: [Left, Right, Top, Bottom pixel borders]
- Fill Center: [Stretch vs. Tile center region]
- Sprite Mode: [Multiple for UI atlas, Single for individual elements]
- Pixels Per Unit: [Consistent across all UI sprites]
```

### Mobile UI Best Practices
```markdown
Touch Interface Guidelines:
- **Minimum Touch Target**: 44x44 pixels (iOS) / 48x48dp (Android)
- **Thumb Zones**: Primary actions in easy reach areas
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear pressed states and animations
- **Gesture Areas**: Adequate space for swipe and drag actions
- **Safe Areas**: Respect device-specific screen boundaries
```

### UI Animation Considerations
```markdown
Animation-Ready Asset Design:
- **State Variations**: Normal, highlighted, pressed, disabled
- **Transition Elements**: Intermediate frames for smooth animations
- **Scalable Components**: Assets that work at different sizes
- **Performance**: Optimized for Unity's UI animation systems
```

### Cross-Platform UI Scaling
```markdown
Multi-Platform UI Strategy:
- **Mobile**: Touch-optimized, larger elements, simple layouts
- **PC**: Mouse precision, smaller elements, complex layouts
- **Console**: Controller navigation, distance viewing, TV-safe areas
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive layouts for different screen ratios
```
