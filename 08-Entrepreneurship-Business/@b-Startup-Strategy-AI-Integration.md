    "data_ingestion": DataIngestionService(),
    "feature_engineering": FeatureEngineeringService(), 
    "model_training": ModelTrainingService(),
    "model_serving": ModelServingService(),
    "monitoring": ModelMonitoringService(),
    "experimentation": ABTestingService()
}

class AIStartupBackend:
    def __init__(self):
        self.services = services
        self.orchestrator = ServiceOrchestrator()
    
    def deploy_new_model(self, model_config):
        pipeline = self.orchestrator.create_pipeline([
            self.services["data_ingestion"],
            self.services["feature_engineering"],
            self.services["model_training"],
            self.services["model_serving"]
        ])
        return pipeline.execute(model_config)
```

**Real-time AI Pipeline**
```python
from kafka import KafkaProducer, KafkaConsumer
import tensorflow as tf

class RealTimeAIPipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self.producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers=['localhost:9092'])
        self.consumer = KafkaConsumer('input_data', bootstrap_servers=['localhost:9092'])
        self.model = tf.keras.models.load_model('latest_model.h5')
    
    def process_stream(self):
        for message in self.consumer:
            # Real-time inference
            prediction = self.model.predict(message.value)
            
            # Send results downstream
            self.producer.send('predictions', prediction)
            
            # Log for monitoring
            self.log_prediction(message.value, prediction)
```

3. **Optionality Preservation**: Keep multiple strategic paths open
4. **Stress Testing**: Regular adversarial testing of systems

**Implementation:**
```python
class AntifragileAISystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = MultiModelEnsemble()
        self.fallback_systems = FallbackHandler()
        self.adaptation_engine = AdaptationEngine()
    
    def handle_disruption(self, disruption_type):
        if disruption_type == "data_corruption":
            return self.fallback_systems.use_backup_data()
        elif disruption_type == "model_failure":
            return self.models.switch_to_backup_model()
        elif disruption_type == "market_shift":
            return self.adaptation_engine.pivot_strategy()
```

## 💡 Key Strategic Highlights

### Strategic Decision Framework
```python
def evaluate_ai_strategy(opportunity):
    scores = {
        'technical_feasibility': assess_technical_feasibility(opportunity),
        'market_readiness': assess_market_readiness(opportunity),
        'competitive_advantage': assess_competitive_advantage(opportunity),
        'data_availability': assess_data_availability(opportunity),
        'regulatory_risk': assess_regulatory_risk(opportunity)
    }
    
    weighted_score = sum(score * weight for score, weight in scores.items())
    
    if weighted_score > 0.7:
        return "GREEN_LIGHT"
    elif weighted_score > 0.5:
        return "PROCEED_WITH_CAUTION"
    else:
        return "PIVOT_REQUIRED"
```
