# @a-AI-Enhanced-Version-Control - Intelligent Git Workflows for Modern Development

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
- Implement AI-powered Git workflows that automate routine version control tasks
- Master intelligent commit message generation and branch management strategies
- Create automated code review and merge conflict resolution systems
- Integrate AI assistants with Git for enhanced productivity and code quality

## ðŸ”§ Intelligent Commit Management

### AI-Powered Commit Message Generation
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# AI-enhanced Git commit script

# Function to generate intelligent commit messages
generate_commit_message() {
    local staged_changes=$(git diff --cached --name-only)
    local diff_content=$(git diff --cached)
    
    # Use Claude Code CLI to generate commit message
    local ai_message=$(claude-code <<EOF
Analyze these staged changes and generate a concise, descriptive commit message following conventional commit format:

Files changed: $staged_changes

Diff content:
$diff_content

Generate a commit message that:
1. Uses conventional commit format (type(scope): description)
2. Clearly describes what changed and why
3. Is under 50 characters for the subject line
4. Includes body if changes are complex

Return only the commit message, no additional text.

For each file, consider:
1. Related functionality changes
2. Bug fixes vs new features
3. Refactoring vs logic changes
4. Documentation updates

Suggest which files should be staged together and provide reasoning.
