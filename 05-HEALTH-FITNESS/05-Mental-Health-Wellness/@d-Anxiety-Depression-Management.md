## üõ†Ô∏è ==Evidence-Based== Treatment Approaches

### ==Cognitive Behavioral Therapy== (CBT) Techniques
**Thought Record Process**:
```yaml
5-Column Thought Record:
  Situation: Specific triggering event at work
  Emotion: What you felt (rate 1-10 intensity)
  Automatic Thought: First thought that came to mind
  Evidence For/Against: Realistic evaluation
  Balanced Thought: More accurate, helpful perspective

Example:
  Situation: "Code review feedback received"
  Emotion: "Anxiety (8/10), Shame (7/10)"
  Automatic Thought: "I'm a terrible programmer"
  Evidence Against: "Feedback is normal, I've written good code before"
  Balanced Thought: "This feedback helps me improve specific areas"
```

**Common Cognitive Distortions in Tech**:
- **All-or-Nothing**: "If my code has bugs, I'm completely incompetent"
- **Mental Filter**: Focusing only on negative feedback, ignoring positive
- **Imposter Syndrome**: "I don't deserve this position, I'll be found out"
- **Catastrophizing**: "One mistake will ruin my entire career"
- **Mind Reading**: "Everyone thinks I'm not technical enough"

  Recovery Activities:
    - Physical exercise (3-4 times per week)
    - Social activities outside work
    - Hobbies and creative pursuits
    - Nature exposure and outdoor time
