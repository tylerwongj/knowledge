## ðŸ”§ Lighting Science for Developers

### Light's Impact on Visual Performance
```yaml
Photopic Vision (Bright Light Conditions):
  - Optimal for detail work and reading code
  - Requires 500-1000 lux for comfortable viewing
  - Cone cells dominate for color discrimination
  - Best contrast sensitivity and acuity

Mesopic Vision (Intermediate Light):
  - Transition zone between bright and dim conditions
  - 10-500 lux range
  - Both rods and cones active
  - Reduced color discrimination but maintained acuity

Scotopic Vision (Low Light):
  - Rod cells dominate (no color vision)
  - Below 10 lux
  - Poor for coding and detail work
  - Can cause eye strain and fatigue
```

### Circadian Rhythm and Cognitive Performance
```yaml
Light's Role in Alertness:
  Morning (6-12 PM):
    - Blue-rich light (5000-6500K) promotes alertness
    - Higher intensity (1000+ lux) for activation
    - Helps establish circadian rhythm
    - Enhances focus and concentration

  Afternoon (12-6 PM):
    - Maintain bright, cool light for sustained performance
    - Gradual transition to warmer tones after 4 PM
    - Prevent afternoon energy dips
    - Support continued productivity

  Evening (6-10 PM):
    - Warm light (2700-3000K) for wind-down
    - Reduced intensity (200-500 lux)
    - Minimize blue light exposure
    - Prepare for sleep cycle
