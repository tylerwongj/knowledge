  Distance: Close enough to maintain neutral wrists
  Mouse: Same level as keyboard, within easy reach
  Wrist Position: Neutral (not extended or flexed)
  Forearm Support: Light support if needed, not wrist support
```

### Standing Surface Optimization

Anti-Fatigue Mat Selection:
  Thickness: 3/4 to 1 inch for optimal support
  Firmness: Medium density (not too soft or hard)
  Size: Large enough for movement and position changes
  Material: High-quality polyurethane or gel-filled
  Features: Beveled edges, non-slip bottom

Footwear Considerations:
  Heel Height: Minimal (less than 1 inch)
  Arch Support: Good arch support for foot alignment
  Cushioning: Adequate heel and forefoot padding
  Fit: Proper size with room for toe movement
  Material: Breathable materials for comfort

Alternative Standing Surfaces:
