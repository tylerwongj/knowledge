## 😴 Sleep Science Fundamentals

### Sleep Architecture and Cycles
```yaml
Sleep Stages:
  Stage 1 (Light Sleep): 5% of night
    - Transition from wake to sleep
    - Easy to wake up
    - 5-10 minute duration

  Stage 2 (Light Sleep): 45% of night
    - Sleep spindles and K-complexes
    - Temperature and heart rate decrease
    - Memory consolidation begins

  Stage 3 (Deep Sleep): 25% of night
    - Delta wave brain activity
    - Physical restoration and growth
    - Immune system strengthening
    - Difficult to wake up

  REM Sleep: 25% of night
    - Rapid eye movement
    - Vivid dreams
    - Memory consolidation
    - Emotional processing
```

### Circadian Rhythm Management
```yaml
Core Body Temperature Rhythm:
  6:00 AM: Lowest body temperature
  10:00 AM: Peak alertness begins
  2:30 PM: Best coordination
  3:30 PM: Fastest reaction time
  5:00 PM: Greatest cardiovascular efficiency
  6:30 PM: Highest blood pressure
  7:00 PM: Highest body temperature
  9:00 PM: Melatonin secretion begins
  10:30 PM: Bowel movements suppressed
  2:00 AM: Deepest sleep
  4:30 AM: Lowest body temperature

Light Exposure Timing:
  Morning: Bright light (10,000+ lux) for 15-30 minutes
  Afternoon: Natural sunlight exposure
  Evening: Dim warm light (<50 lux)
  Night: Complete darkness or red light only
```
