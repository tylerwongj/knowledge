## 🎨 Advanced Napping Techniques

### Caffeine Nap (Napuccino)
```yaml

  Scientific Rationale:
    - Adenosine clearance: Nap removes sleep-promoting chemicals
    - Caffeine blocking: Prevents re-accumulation of drowsiness
    - Synergistic effect: Combined benefits exceed individual effects
    - Optimal timing: 20 minutes matches caffeine absorption
    
  Implementation:
    - Coffee/tea: Consume quickly before lying down
    - Alternative: Caffeine pills for precise dosing
    - Timing: Critical 20-minute duration
    - Recovery: Immediate bright light exposure upon waking
```
