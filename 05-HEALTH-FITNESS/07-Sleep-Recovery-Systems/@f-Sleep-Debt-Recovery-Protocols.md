- Understand cognitive performance recovery timelines
- Develop sustainable protocols for managing irregular developer schedules

## ðŸ“Š Understanding Sleep Debt Mechanics

### Sleep Debt Calculation Framework
```yaml
Sleep Debt Fundamentals:
  Daily Sleep Need: 7-9 hours (individual baseline)
  Minimum Functional: 6 hours (temporary sustainability)
  Sleep Debt Accumulation: (Required Sleep - Actual Sleep) * Days
  Recovery Ratio: 1.5:1 (90 minutes recovery per 60 minutes debt)
  
Developer-Specific Factors:
  Cognitive Load Impact: High mental work increases sleep need by 15-30 minutes
  Screen Time Effect: Blue light exposure extends required recovery time
  Irregular Schedule: Variable bedtimes compound sleep debt effects
  Caffeine Masking: Stimulants hide but don't eliminate sleep debt symptoms
```

### Sleep Debt Assessment Matrix
```python
# Comprehensive sleep debt tracking system
class SleepDebtCalculator:
    def __init__(self, baseline_sleep_need=8.0):
        self.baseline_need = baseline_sleep_need
        self.sleep_history = []
        self.performance_metrics = []
        
    def calculate_current_debt(self):
        """
        Calculate accumulated sleep debt over time
        """
        total_debt = 0
        for day_data in self.sleep_history[-14:]:  # Last 14 days
            daily_deficit = max(0, self.baseline_need - day_data['sleep_duration'])
            # Apply decay factor for older debt
            age_factor = 1.0 - (day_data['days_ago'] * 0.1)
            total_debt += daily_deficit * max(0.3, age_factor)
            
        return {
            'total_debt_hours': total_debt,
            'severity_level': self.categorize_debt_severity(total_debt),
            'recovery_time_estimate': self.estimate_recovery_time(total_debt),
            'performance_impact': self.predict_performance_impact(total_debt)
        }
        
    def categorize_debt_severity(self, debt_hours):
        if debt_hours < 2:
            return "Minimal - Minor performance impact"
        elif debt_hours < 5:
            return "Moderate - Noticeable cognitive decline"
        elif debt_hours < 10:
            return "Significant - Major performance impairment"
        else:
            return "Severe - Critical recovery needed"
            
    def estimate_recovery_time(self, debt_hours):
        # Recovery takes longer than accumulation
        base_recovery_days = debt_hours / 2  # 2 hours per day recovery rate
        return {
            'minimum_days': math.ceil(base_recovery_days),
            'optimal_days': math.ceil(base_recovery_days * 1.5),
            'gradual_recovery': math.ceil(base_recovery_days * 2)
        }
```

### Cognitive Performance Impact Tracking
```yaml
Sleep Debt Performance Correlation:
  Attention and Focus:
    - 2 hours debt: 15% decrease in sustained attention
    - 5 hours debt: 35% decrease in focus duration
    - 10+ hours debt: 60% impairment in concentration
    
  Memory and Learning:
    - Minimal debt: Slight decrease in new information retention
    - Moderate debt: 25% reduction in learning efficiency
    - Significant debt: 50% impairment in memory consolidation
    
  Problem-Solving:
    - Creative thinking: First affected by sleep debt
    - Analytical reasoning: Degrades with moderate debt
    - Decision making: Severely impaired with significant debt
    
  Coding-Specific Impacts:
    - Bug introduction rate: Increases exponentially with debt
    - Code review quality: Decreases significantly after 3 hours debt
    - Architecture decisions: Impaired judgment with moderate debt
    - Debugging efficiency: 40% slower with significant debt
