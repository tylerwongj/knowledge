    - Bedroom: 65-68°F (18-20°C)
    - Body cooling: 2-3°F drop initiates sleep
    - Smart thermostats: Automatic temperature scheduling
    - Mattress cooling: Eight Sleep, ChiliPad systems
    
  Light Management:
    - Complete darkness: Blackout curtains, eye masks
    - Blue light elimination: 2 hours before bedtime
    - Circadian lighting: Gradual dimming automation
    - Morning light exposure: 10,000 lux within 30 minutes
    
  Sound Optimization:
    - Noise floor: <30 decibels for optimal sleep
    - White/brown noise: Mask environmental disruptions
    - Earplugs: Foam or custom-molded for side sleepers
    - Sound masking apps: Rain, ocean, or fan sounds
    
  Air Quality Control:
    - Humidity: 30-50% relative humidity
