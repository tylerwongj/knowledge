## üöÄ AI/LLM Integration for Workout Optimization

### Personalized Protocol Generation
```yaml
Custom HIIT Design Prompt:
"Create a personalized high-intensity workout protocol based on:
- Available time: 5-15 minutes per session
- Equipment: [List available equipment or bodyweight only]
- Fitness level: [Current conditioning and experience]
- Physical limitations: [Any injuries or mobility restrictions]
- Goals: [Strength, cardio, flexibility, specific improvements]
- Schedule: [How many days per week, preferred timing]

Include progression plans, modification options, and recovery recommendations."

Workout Variation Generator:
"Generate 4 weeks of varied HIIT workouts to prevent adaptation and boredom:
- Week 1: Foundation building with moderate intensity
- Week 2: Increased complexity and intensity
- Week 3: Peak intensity with advanced movements
- Week 4: Active recovery with mobility focus

Each workout should be 7-12 minutes and target different movement patterns and energy systems."
```

### Performance Tracking Analysis
```yaml
Workout Effectiveness Assessment:
"Analyze my workout performance data and provide optimization recommendations:
- Track improvements in exercise capacity and recovery
- Identify which protocols provide the best results for my goals
- Recommend adjustments based on progress patterns
- Suggest when to increase intensity or change protocols
- Correlate workout timing with energy and productivity levels

Performance Data: [Exercise completion times, heart rate data, perceived exertion]
Goals: [Specific fitness and health objectives]
Schedule Constraints: [Work demands and availability patterns]"
