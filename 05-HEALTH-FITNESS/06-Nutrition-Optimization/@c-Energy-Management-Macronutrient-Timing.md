    - Use: Pre-intense coding sessions (15-30 min before)
    - Sources: Banana, dates, honey
    - Amount: 15-30g
    - Duration: 30-60 minutes energy

  Complex Carbs (Sustained Energy):
    - Use: Meals 2-3 hours before work sessions
    - Sources: Oats, quinoa, sweet potato, brown rice
    - Amount: 30-60g per meal
    - Duration: 2-4 hours sustained energy

  Fiber-Rich Carbs (Steady State):
    - Use: Throughout day for stable blood sugar
    - Sources: Vegetables, legumes, berries
    - Amount: 25-35g fiber daily
    - Benefit: Prevents energy crashes
```

    - High-stress periods: Up to 2g per kg body weight

  Timing for Cognitive Performance:
    - Breakfast: 20-30g for sustained morning energy
    - Lunch: 25-35g to prevent afternoon crash
    - Snacks: 10-15g every 3-4 hours
    - Evening: 20-25g for recovery and sleep quality

  Quality Sources:
    - Complete proteins: Eggs, fish, poultry, dairy
    - Plant combinations: Rice + beans, quinoa + nuts
    - Rapid absorption: Whey protein, Greek yogurt
    - Slow release: Casein, cottage cheese
```
