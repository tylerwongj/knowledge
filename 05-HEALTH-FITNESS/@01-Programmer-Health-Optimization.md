- Screen Brightness: Match surrounding ambient light levels
```

### Keyboard and Mouse Ergonomics
```
Input Device Positioning:
- Keyboard Height: Elbows at 90-degree angle

- Keyboard Tilt: Flat or slight negative tilt preferred

Ergonomic Equipment Recommendations:
- Mechanical keyboards with proper key travel
- Ergonomic mice with appropriate size for hand
- Wrist rests for support during breaks (not active typing)
- Consider split keyboards for natural hand positioning
```

### Chair and Desk Setup
```
Seating Optimization:
- Seat Height: Feet flat on floor, thighs parallel to ground
- Back Support: Lumbar support maintains natural spine curve
- Armrest Height: Arms relaxed, shoulders not hunched
- Seat Depth: 2-3 fingers width between knee and seat edge

Desk Configuration:
- Desk Height: Allows 90-degree elbow angle for typing
- Leg Room: Adequate space for movement and position changes
- Standing Desk Option: Alternating sit/stand throughout day
- Cable Management: Organized to prevent tangling and hazards
```

```

## üí° Cognitive Performance Optimization

### Nutrition for Brain Function
```
Optimal Programming Diet:
Brain-Boosting Foods:
- Omega-3 rich fish (salmon, mackerel, sardines)
- Nuts and seeds (walnuts, pumpkin seeds, chia seeds)
- Berries (blueberries, blackberries for antioxidants)
- Dark leafy greens (spinach, kale for folate)
- Avocados (healthy fats for brain function)
- Dark chocolate (flavonoids for cognitive function)

Sustained Energy Foods:
- Complex carbohydrates (oats, quinoa, sweet potatoes)
- Lean proteins (chicken, turkey, legumes, eggs)
- Healthy fats (olive oil, nuts, seeds)
- Fiber-rich vegetables for stable blood sugar

Foods to Limit:
- Processed foods high in sugar and trans fats
- Excessive caffeine (monitor tolerance and timing)
- High-sodium foods that can cause energy crashes
- Alcohol which impairs cognitive function and sleep
```

### Hydration Strategy
```
Optimal Hydration Protocol:
Daily Water Intake:
- Base requirement: Half body weight in ounces
- Additional 16-20 oz per hour of focused work
- Increase during exercise and hot weather
- Monitor urine color for hydration status

Timing Strategy:
- Morning: 16-20 oz upon waking to rehydrate
- Work sessions: 6-8 oz every hour during coding
- Pre-meal: 8 oz, 30 minutes before eating
- Exercise: 16-24 oz before, during, and after workouts
- Evening: Moderate intake to avoid sleep disruption

Hydration Enhancement:
- Add electrolytes during intense work sessions
- Herbal teas for variety and additional benefits
- Coconut water for natural electrolyte replacement
- Avoid excessive diuretics (coffee, alcohol, sugar)
```
