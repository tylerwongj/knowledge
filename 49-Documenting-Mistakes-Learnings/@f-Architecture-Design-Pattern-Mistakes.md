## üîß Core Architecture Mistake Categories

### Over-Engineering and Premature Optimization
```csharp
// ‚ùå Common Mistake: Complex architecture for simple game
// Implementing full ECS for a Pong clone
public class EntityComponentSystem
{
    private Dictionary<Type, ISystem> systems;
    private Dictionary<int, Dictionary<Type, IComponent>> entities;
    private ComponentPool<Transform> transformPool;
    // 500+ lines for a 2-paddle game...
}

// ‚úÖ Better Approach: Appropriate complexity for scope
public class PongGame : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform leftPaddle, rightPaddle, ball;
    public float paddleSpeed = 5f;
    public float ballSpeed = 3f;
    
    void Update()
    {
        HandleInput();
        MoveBall();
        CheckCollisions();
    }
}
```

### Singleton Abuse and Global State Problems
```csharp
// ‚ùå Mistake: Everything as a singleton
public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour { public static GameManager Instance; }
public class AudioManager : MonoBehaviour { public static AudioManager Instance; }
public class UIManager : MonoBehaviour { public static UIManager Instance; }
public class PlayerManager : MonoBehaviour { public static PlayerManager Instance; }
public class ScoreManager : MonoBehaviour { public static ScoreManager Instance; }
// Result: Tightly coupled, hard to test, initialization order issues

// ‚úÖ Better Approach: Dependency injection and composition
public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private AudioManager audioManager;
    [SerializeField] private UIManager uiManager;
    [SerializeField] private PlayerController playerController;
    
    // Explicit dependencies, testable, clear relationships
}
```

### Inappropriate Pattern Usage
```csharp
// ‚ùå Mistake: Observer pattern overkill for simple communication
public class HealthSystem : MonoBehaviour
{
    public event Action<float> OnHealthChanged;
    public event Action OnHealthZero;
    public event Action<float> OnHealthIncreased;
    public event Action<float> OnHealthDecreased;
    public event Action<float> OnHealthMaxChanged;
    // 15 different events for simple health changes
}

// ‚úÖ Better Approach: Single event with context
public class HealthSystem : MonoBehaviour
{
    [System.Serializable]
    public class HealthChangeEvent
    {
        public float previousHealth;
        public float currentHealth;
        public float maxHealth;
        public HealthChangeType changeType;
    }
    
    public UnityEvent<HealthChangeEvent> OnHealthChanged;
}
```

### Violation of Unity's Component-Based Architecture
```csharp
// ‚ùå Mistake: Massive monolithic components
public class Player : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Movement variables
    public float speed, jumpForce;
    private Rigidbody rb;
    
    // Combat variables
    public int health, damage;
    public GameObject weaponPrefab;
    
    // Inventory variables
    public List<Item> inventory;
    public int maxItems;
    
    // UI variables
    public Slider healthBar;
    public Text inventoryDisplay;
    
    // 500+ lines of mixed responsibilities
}

// ‚úÖ Better Approach: Focused, single-responsibility components
public class PlayerMovement : MonoBehaviour { /* Movement only */ }
public class PlayerHealth : MonoBehaviour { /* Health only */ }
public class PlayerInventory : MonoBehaviour { /* Inventory only */ }
public class PlayerCombat : MonoBehaviour { /* Combat only */ }
// Each component has clear, focused responsibility
```

## üöÄ AI/LLM Integration for Architecture Decisions

### Architecture Review and Analysis
```prompt
Review this Unity script architecture for design pattern appropriateness:

Context: [Describe game type, scope, team size]
Current approach: [Paste code or describe architecture]
Concerns: [Performance, maintainability, scalability issues]

Analyze:
1. Are the design patterns appropriate for the scope?
2. Is there over-engineering or under-engineering?
3. How does this fit Unity's component-based architecture?
4. What are the long-term maintenance implications?
5. Suggest specific improvements with code examples
```

### Pattern Selection Guidance
```prompt
Help me choose the right design pattern for this Unity scenario:

Problem: [Specific architectural challenge]
Game scope: [Small prototype / Medium indie / Large production]
Team size: [Solo / Small team / Large team]
Performance requirements: [Mobile / PC / Console specific needs]
Timeline: [Prototype / Production / Long-term maintenance]

Recommend:
1. Most appropriate pattern with Unity examples
2. Simpler alternatives if over-engineering risk exists
3. Implementation steps and potential pitfalls
4. Testing and maintenance considerations
```

### Refactoring Strategy Development
```prompt
Generate a refactoring plan for this Unity architecture:

Current state: [Describe current architecture problems]
Target state: [Desired architectural improvements]
Constraints: [Timeline, team, compatibility requirements]

Provide:
1. Step-by-step refactoring plan
2. Risk mitigation strategies
3. Testing approach for each step
4. Rollback plans if refactoring fails
5. Metrics to measure improvement
```

## üí° Key Highlights

### Most Common Architecture Anti-Patterns
1. **God Objects**: Single components handling multiple responsibilities
2. **Singleton Overuse**: Global state causing tight coupling and testing difficulties
3. **Premature Optimization**: Complex patterns for simple problems
4. **Pattern Misapplication**: Using inappropriate patterns due to misunderstanding
5. **Unity Anti-Patterns**: Fighting against Unity's component-based design

### Architecture Decision Framework
```markdown
Pattern Selection Checklist:
- [ ] Does this pattern solve a real problem I currently have?
- [ ] Is the complexity justified by the benefit?
- [ ] How does this interact with Unity's component system?
- [ ] Can I test this architecture easily?
- [ ] Will this scale with my project's expected growth?
- [ ] Can team members understand and maintain this?
```

### Refactoring Red Flags
```markdown
Signs Architecture Needs Attention:
- [ ] Components exceeding 200 lines regularly
- [ ] Difficult to add new features without touching many files
- [ ] Testing is painful or impossible
- [ ] Frequent null reference exceptions
- [ ] Performance issues that can't be isolated
- [ ] Team members avoiding certain code areas
```

### Unity-Specific Architecture Guidelines
```csharp
// Good Unity Architecture Principles

// 1. Favor Composition over Inheritance
public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private MovementComponent movement;
    [SerializeField] private HealthComponent health;
    [SerializeField] private InputComponent input;
}

// 2. Use ScriptableObjects for Configuration
[CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "PlayerConfig", menuName = "Game/Player Config")]
public class PlayerConfig : ScriptableObject
{
    public float speed;
    public int health;
    public LayerMask groundLayers;
}

// 3. Implement Interfaces for Testability
public interface IDamageable
{
    void TakeDamage(int amount);
    int CurrentHealth { get; }
}

// 4. Use Unity Events for Loose Coupling
public class HealthComponent : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private UnityEvent<int> OnHealthChanged;
    [SerializeField] private UnityEvent OnDeath;
}
```
