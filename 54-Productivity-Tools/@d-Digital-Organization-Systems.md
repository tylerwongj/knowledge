```

### File Naming Conventions
```markdown
Naming Standards:
├── Scripts: PascalCase (PlayerController.cs, GameManager.cs)
├── Prefabs: PascalCase with type suffix (Player_Character, UI_MainMenu)
├── Scenes: PascalCase with version (Level01_v003, MainMenu_v001)
├── Assets: lowercase with underscores (player_idle_01, ui_button_normal)
├── Folders: PascalCase with numbers (01-Scripts, 02-Prefabs)
└── Documentation: kebab-case (game-design-doc, technical-requirements)

Version Control Integration:
- Include version numbers in file names for major iterations
- Use semantic versioning for project releases (v1.2.3)
- Tag important milestones in version control
- Maintain changelog for significant updates
```

## 🚀 AI/LLM Integration for Digital Organization

### Automated File Organization
**Smart Folder Assignment:**
```
"Analyze this Unity project file and suggest the optimal folder location based on its content and purpose: [FILE_PATH_AND_CONTENT]"
```

**Naming Convention Enforcement:**
```
"Check these file names against Unity development best practices and suggest improvements: [FILE_LIST]"
```

**Duplicate Detection and Cleanup:**
```
"Identify duplicate or redundant files in this Unity project structure and recommend consolidation: [PROJECT_STRUCTURE]"
```

### Intelligent Information Retrieval
- **Content-Based Search**: AI-powered search across code, documentation, and assets
- **Context-Aware Suggestions**: Recommend related files when working on specific features
- **Project Documentation**: Auto-generate documentation from code comments and structure
- **Dependency Mapping**: Visualize relationships between project components

## 💡 Knowledge Management Systems

```csharp
// Asset organization script example
public class ProjectOrganizer : EditorWindow
{
    [MenuItem("Tools/Organization/Clean Project")]
    public static void CleanProject()
    {
        // Remove empty folders
        // Organize assets by type
        // Update asset references
        // Generate organization report
    }
    
    [MenuItem("Tools/Organization/Validate Naming")]
    public static void ValidateNaming()
    {
        // Check naming conventions
        // Suggest improvements
        // Batch rename operations
        // Update documentation
    }
}
```

### Automated Documentation Generation
- **Code Documentation**: Auto-generate API docs from comments
- **Project README**: Template-based project documentation
- **Asset Catalogs**: Automated inventory of project resources
- **Build Reports**: Detailed compilation and deployment logs
