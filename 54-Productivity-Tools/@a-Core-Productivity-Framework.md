### Productivity System Architecture
```markdown
Daily Workflow:
â”œâ”€â”€ Morning Planning (AI-generated task prioritization)
â”œâ”€â”€ Deep Work Blocks (Unity development focus time)
â”œâ”€â”€ Administrative Batch (emails, meetings, research)
â”œâ”€â”€ Learning Sessions (structured knowledge acquisition)
â””â”€â”€ Evening Review (progress assessment and next-day planning)
```

## ðŸš€ AI/LLM Integration Opportunities

### Automated Productivity Enhancement
**Task Breakdown Prompt:**
```
"Break down this Unity development task into specific, actionable steps with time estimates: [TASK_DESCRIPTION]"
```

**Priority Assessment Prompt:**
```
"Rank these tasks by impact on Unity developer career advancement: [TASK_LIST]"
```

**Context Switching Analysis:**
```
"Analyze my daily schedule and suggest optimal batching for similar tasks: [SCHEDULE]"
```
