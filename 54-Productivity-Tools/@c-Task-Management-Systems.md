## 🔧 Core Task Management Architecture

### Task Capture and Processing System
```markdown
Inbox Processing Flow:
1. Capture (All tasks, ideas, and commitments)
   ├── Voice notes (mobile quick capture)
   ├── Email-to-task automation
   ├── Unity project todos (inline code comments)
   └── Meeting action items (automatic extraction)

2. Clarify (Define actionable outcomes)
   ├── Is it actionable? (Yes/No decision)
   ├── What's the specific next action?
   ├── How long will it take? (time estimation)
   └── What Unity skills does it develop?

3. Organize (Categorize by context and priority)
   ├── Unity Development Projects
   ├── Learning/Skill Building
   ├── Career Advancement
   ├── Administrative Tasks
   └── Personal/Maintenance

4. Review (Regular system maintenance)
   ├── Daily priority selection
   ├── Weekly project review
   ├── Monthly goal alignment
   └── Quarterly system optimization
```

### AI-Enhanced Task Categorization
```python
# Task classification system
task_categories = {
    "unity_core": {
        "scripting": ["C# development", "component creation", "game logic"],
        "design": ["scene building", "level design", "UI implementation"],
        "optimization": ["performance tuning", "memory management", "build optimization"],
        "integration": ["asset import", "third-party tools", "version control"]
    },
    "career_development": {
        "portfolio": ["project documentation", "showcase refinement", "demo creation"],
        "skills": ["tutorial completion", "technique practice", "tool mastery"],
        "networking": ["community engagement", "professional connections", "industry research"],
        "applications": ["resume updates", "cover letters", "interview prep"]
    },
    "learning_growth": {
        "structured": ["course completion", "certification pursuit", "formal education"],
        "experimental": ["proof of concepts", "technique exploration", "creative projects"],
        "research": ["documentation reading", "best practice study", "industry trends"]
    }
}
```

## 🚀 AI/LLM Integration for Task Management

### Intelligent Task Breakdown
**Complex Project Decomposition:**
```
"Break down this Unity game development project into specific, manageable tasks with time estimates and skill requirements: [PROJECT_DESCRIPTION]"
```

**Sprint Planning Automation:**
```
"Create a 2-week sprint plan from these Unity development tasks, considering dependencies and skill progression: [TASK_BACKLOG]"
```

**Priority Matrix Generation:**
```
"Rank these tasks using Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent/Important) for Unity developer career goals: [TASK_LIST]"
```

### Automated Task Enhancement
- **Context Detection**: Automatically assign appropriate tags and categories
- **Dependency Mapping**: Identify task prerequisites and sequencing
- **Time Estimation**: AI-powered duration prediction based on historical data
- **Skill Development Tracking**: Map tasks to Unity competency advancement

### Agile Workflow Adaptation for Solo Development
```markdown
Weekly Sprint Structure:
├── Monday: Sprint Planning & Task Prioritization
├── Tuesday-Thursday: Core Development (Deep Work Blocks)
├── Friday: Testing, Bug Fixes, and Documentation
├── Weekend: Learning, Research, and Experimental Work

Daily Standup (Self-Assessment):
- What did I complete yesterday?
- What will I work on today?
- What obstacles am I facing?
- How does today's work advance Unity career goals?
```

## 🔄 Task Execution and Progress Tracking

### Daily Task Management Workflow
```markdown
Morning Planning (15 minutes):
1. Review yesterday's completion status
2. AI-generated priority ranking for today
3. Select 3-5 primary focus tasks
4. Identify potential obstacles and solutions
5. Set specific, measurable daily goals

Execution Phase:
├── Time-blocked task execution
├── Progress logging every 30 minutes
├── Obstacle documentation and problem-solving
└── Context switching minimization

Evening Review (10 minutes):
1. Mark completed tasks and log time spent
2. Note incomplete tasks and reasons
3. Update project progress and next steps
4. Feed data to AI system for tomorrow's planning
```

    // Link to specific scripts and line numbers
}

[MenuItem("Tools/Task Management/Export Project Tasks")]
public static void ExportProjectTasks()
{
    // Scan project for TODO comments
    // Generate task list with context
    // Export to main task management system
}
```
