## 🚀 AI/LLM Integration for Analytics

### Intelligent Data Analysis
**Productivity Pattern Recognition:**
```
"Analyze my productivity data and identify optimal work patterns for Unity development: [PRODUCTIVITY_DATA]"
```

**Performance Correlation Analysis:**
```
"Find correlations between my energy levels, task types, and output quality to optimize scheduling: [ENERGY_AND_OUTPUT_DATA]"
```

**Goal Progress Assessment:**
```
"Evaluate my progress toward Unity developer career goals and suggest priority adjustments: [GOALS_AND_METRICS]"
```
