## 🚀 AI/LLM Integration for Archetype Optimization

### Automated Archetype Detection
```prompt
"Analyze draft picks and available cards: [current picks], [pack contents], [format].
Identify viable archetypes with assessment:
- Probability of successful completion (0-100%)
- Required pieces still needed with availability odds
- Power level ranking in current meta (1-10)
- Consistency rating and failure modes
- Optimal pivot points and alternative paths
Generate ranked archetype recommendations with reasoning."
```

### Meta-Game Archetype Analysis
```prompt
"Process format data: [recent tournament results], [archetype win rates], [card usage stats].
Generate archetype tier list including:
- S-Tier: Dominant strategies with >60% win rate
- A-Tier: Strong strategies with 55-60% win rate  
- B-Tier: Viable strategies with 50-55% win rate
- C-Tier: Situational strategies with <50% win rate
Include meta predictions and counter-strategy recommendations."
```

### Personalized Archetype Recommendations
```prompt
"Analyze player performance: [draft history], [archetype success rates], [play style].
Generate personalized archetype recommendations:
- Strength-based archetype matching
- Improvement opportunity identification
- Skill development pathway suggestions
- Risk tolerance archetype alignment
- Success probability modeling per archetype
Create individual archetype mastery roadmap."
```

## 💡 Advanced Archetype Optimization Techniques

### Archetype Commitment Framework
```
Commitment Levels:
1. Exploration (Picks 1-3): Keep options open, value flexibility
2. Direction (Picks 4-6): Lean toward archetype, maintain exits
3. Commitment (Picks 7-10): Lock into strategy, optimize build
4. Refinement (Picks 11-14): Fine-tune curve and synergies
5. Completion (Pick 15): Final deck optimization
```

### Pivot Point Analysis
- **Early Pivot** (Picks 2-4): Minimal sunk cost, maximum flexibility
- **Mid Pivot** (Picks 5-8): Moderate investment, calculated risk
- **Late Pivot** (Picks 9-12): High cost, emergency situations only
- **Impossible Pivot** (Picks 13+): Strategy locked, optimization only

### Hybrid Strategy Development
- **Primary Archetype** (60-70% commitment): Main game plan
- **Secondary Elements** (20-30% commitment): Backup strategies
- **Tertiary Options** (10% commitment): Emergency pivots
- **Flexibility Maintenance**: Keeping doors open for opportunities

## 🎮 Format-Specific Archetype Systems

### Magic: The Gathering Archetypes
```
Common Draft Archetypes:
- Aggro (Red/White): Low curve, efficient creatures, burn
- Control (Blue/Black): Removal, card draw, win conditions
- Midrange (Green/X): Ramp, threats, value creatures
- Combo (Various): Synergy pieces, protection, enablers
- Tribal (Various): Creature type synergies, lords, payoffs

Evaluation Criteria:
- Mana Curve Optimization: 1-6 drop distribution
- Color Commitment: Single vs multi-color requirements
- Synergy Density: Critical mass for consistent execution
- Removal Package: Answer density and quality
- Win Condition Clarity: Path to victory identification
```

### Hearthstone Arena Archetypes
```
Arena Strategy Types:
- Tempo: Efficient trades, board control, pressure
- Value: Card advantage, resource management, late game
- Aggro: Fast damage, reach, early pressure
- Control: Removal, healing, powerful late game
- Curve: Smooth mana progression, consistent plays

Key Considerations:
- Class Power Level: Hero power synergy
- Card Quality Threshold: Individual power minimum
- Curve Distribution: Mana cost optimization
- Answer Density: Removal and silence effects
- Win Condition Access: Finisher availability
```
