- **Historical Signals**: Past draft patterns and preferences

## 🚀 AI/LLM Integration for Signal Processing

### Automated Signal Detection
```prompt
"Analyze draft signals from pack flow data: [pack 1-3 picks], [position], [format].
Identify and rank signals by strength:
- Color availability (open/closed lanes)
- Archetype viability (supported strategies)
- Cut assessment (blocked upstream strategies)
- Wheel predictions (likely late picks)
- Player read development (behavior patterns)
Generate confidence-weighted signal report."
```

### Pattern Recognition Enhancement
```prompt
"Process draft history: [previous drafts], [seat positions], [results].
Develop player modeling including:
- Picking preference patterns
- Archetype tendency analysis
- Risk tolerance assessment
- Signal response behaviors
- Deviation from optimal play
Create predictive behavioral profiles."
```

### Real-Time Signal Synthesis
```prompt
"Synthesize current draft state: [pick 8 pack 2], [previous picks], [signals received].
Generate strategic recommendations:
- Strongest signals and implications
- Pivot opportunities and timing
- Risk assessment for current path
- Alternative strategy evaluation
- Information gaps requiring attention
Format as decision support briefing."
```

## 💡 Advanced Signal Processing Techniques

### Bayesian Signal Updating
```
P(Strategy Viable | Signal) = P(Signal | Strategy Viable) × P(Strategy Viable) / P(Signal)

Base Rate: Format archetype success rate
Likelihood: Signal strength given strategy viability
Posterior: Updated probability after signal observation
```

### Signal Strength Quantification
- **Strong Signals** (90%+ confidence): Multiple late premium cards
- **Medium Signals** (70-90% confidence): Consistent mid-tier availability  
- **Weak Signals** (50-70% confidence): Single indicator or noisy data
- **False Signals** (<50% confidence): Contradictory or unreliable information
- **No Signal** (baseline): Insufficient information for assessment

### Information Decay Models
- **Temporal Decay**: Older signals lose relevance over time
- **Position Decay**: Distance-based reliability reduction
- **Pack Decay**: Early vs late pack signal strength differences
- **Meta Decay**: Format evolution impact on signal validity
- **Player Decay**: Behavioral consistency over draft duration

## 🎮 Format-Specific Signal Systems

### Magic: The Gathering Signals
```
Color Signal Strength:
- Pack 1, Pick 8+: Premium cards in color = STRONG OPEN
- Pack 1, Pick 5-7: Good cards available = MEDIUM OPEN
- Pack 1, Pick 3-4: Decent cards available = WEAK OPEN
- Pack 1, Pick 1-2: Only bad cards = LIKELY CLOSED

Archetype Signals:
- Synergy pieces late = Strategy under-drafted
- Build-around missing = Strategy over-drafted  
- Enablers available = Deck viable if commitment made
```

```
Class Signal Indicators:
- High-value class cards late in pack = Class under-drafted
- Removal spells available = Control strategies viable
- Aggressive cards flowing = Tempo strategies supported
- Card draw effects late = Value strategies possible

Meta Shift Signals:
- New card availability = Meta adjustment opportunities
- Traditional picks changing = Player adaptation required
```

### Board Game Draft Signals (7 Wonders)
```
Resource Signal Reading:
- Resource cards late = Economic strategy viable
- Military cards flowing = Conflict strategy under-drafted
- Science cards available = Tech strategy possible
- Neighbor resource needs = Denial opportunities
```
