- Create active learning workflows using highlighting as a tool
- Develop systematic approaches to knowledge consolidation

## ðŸ”§ Scientific Highlighting Strategies

### Cognitive Load Theory Application
```markdown
# Highlighting Strategy Based on Information Processing

## Primary Information (Red Highlights)
==Core concepts that form foundational understanding==
- Unity's MonoBehaviour lifecycle
- C# inheritance principles
- Component-based architecture

## Secondary Information (Blue Highlights)
==Implementation details and practical applications==
- GetComponent caching strategies
- Coroutine best practices
- Performance optimization techniques

## Tertiary Information (Green Highlights)
==Supporting examples and context==
- Code examples demonstrating concepts
- Real-world application scenarios
- Alternative approaches and considerations

# Cognitive Load Management
!!Never highlight more than 20% of any text block!!
??Focus on relationships between highlighted concepts??
--Remove irrelevant details through strategic non-highlighting--
```

### Active Learning Integration
```markdown
# Transform Highlights into Learning Activities

## Concept Mapping from Highlights
==Unity GameObject== connects to ==Transform Component==
==Transform Component== enables ==Position/Rotation/Scale==
==Component System== supports ==Composition over Inheritance==

## Question Generation
After highlighting key concepts, create questions:
??How does Unity's component system differ from traditional OOP inheritance??
??What are the performance implications of GetComponent calls??
??When should I use ScriptableObjects vs MonoBehaviour components??

## Elaborative Interrogation
==Cached component references improve performance== 
*Why?* Because GetComponent uses reflection and string comparison
*How?* Store references in Awake() or Start() methods
*When?* For components accessed frequently (Update, FixedUpdate)

## Self-Explanation Protocol
==Object pooling reduces garbage collection==
*This works because*: Reusing objects prevents constant allocation/deallocation
*This connects to*: Memory management and performance optimization
*This matters for*: Mobile development and smooth gameplay
```

### Spaced Repetition with Highlights

#### Obsidian Spaced Repetition Plugin Integration
```markdown
# Flashcard Generation from Highlights

==Unity's MonoBehaviour lifecycle methods execute in specific order== #flashcard
What is the execution order of Unity's MonoBehaviour lifecycle methods?
?
Awake() â†’ OnEnable() â†’ Start() â†’ Update()/FixedUpdate() â†’ OnDisable() â†’ OnDestroy()

==Component caching prevents expensive GetComponent calls== #flashcard/performance
Why should you cache component references in Unity?
?
GetComponent uses reflection and is expensive. Caching in Awake() improves performance.

==Coroutines enable asynchronous operations without blocking main thread== #flashcard/async
How do coroutines help with game development?
?
They allow time-based operations (delays, animations) without freezing gameplay.

# Progressive Review Intervals
- Day 1: Review all highlighted concepts
- Day 3: Review concepts marked as "difficult" 
- Day 7: Review all concepts again
- Day 14: Focus on practical applications
- Day 30: Comprehensive review and connection-building
```

### Semantic Highlighting Framework

#### Information Type Classification
```markdown
# Systematic Highlighting by Information Type

## Declarative Knowledge (Purple)
==Unity uses a component-based architecture==
==C# is an object-oriented programming language==
==GameObjects are containers for components==

## Procedural Knowledge (Blue)
==To cache a component: var rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>() in Awake()==
==To create a coroutine: StartCoroutine(MethodName())==
==To optimize Update: minimize operations and cache references==

## Conditional Knowledge (Orange)
==Use FixedUpdate for physics-related updates==
==Use Update for input handling and UI updates==
==Use LateUpdate for camera following and post-processing==

## Metacognitive Knowledge (Green)
==Understanding when to use each Unity lifecycle method==
==Recognizing performance bottlenecks in game code==
==Knowing when to apply specific design patterns==
```

### Pattern Recognition Training

#### Highlighting for Pattern Detection
```markdown
# Pattern Highlighting Strategy

## Design Pattern Recognition
==Singleton pattern: GameManager.Instance.method()== #pattern/singleton
==Observer pattern: event subscription/unsubscription== #pattern/observer
==Object Pool pattern: reuse expensive objects== #pattern/objectpool
==State Machine pattern: behavior state transitions== #pattern/statemachine

## Anti-Pattern Detection
--GameObject.Find in Update() loops-- #antipattern/performance
--Public fields without SerializeField-- #antipattern/encapsulation
--Unmanaged event subscriptions-- #antipattern/memory
--Complex Update() methods-- #antipattern/architecture

## Best Practice Patterns
==Cache component references in Awake()== #bestpractice/performance
==Use events for loose coupling== #bestpractice/architecture
==Implement proper cleanup in OnDestroy()== #bestpractice/memory
==Follow single responsibility principle== #bestpractice/design
```

### Retention Verification System

#### Self-Testing with Highlights
```markdown
# Active Recall Testing

## Cover-and-Recall Method
1. Read section and identify key highlights
2. Cover the highlighted text
3. Attempt to recall the highlighted information
4. Check accuracy and adjust highlighting

## Concept Mapping Verification
==Unity MonoBehaviour== â†’ ??connects to?? â†’ ==Component System==
==Performance Optimization== â†’ ??includes?? â†’ ==Caching, Pooling, Profiling==
==C# Design Patterns== â†’ ??applied in?? â†’ ==Unity Game Development==

## Feynman Technique Integration
After highlighting concepts, explain them simply:
==Component-based architecture== means:
"Instead of one big class with everything, Unity uses small components that do one thing each. You attach these to GameObjects like LEGO blocks."

## Teaching Others Protocol
Highlighted concepts should be explainable to someone learning Unity:
==Object pooling== â†’ "Instead of creating and destroying bullets constantly, make a bunch once and reuse them"
==Coroutines== â†’ "Like setting a timer that doesn't stop your game from running"
```

### Adaptive Highlighting Strategies

#### Difficulty-Based Highlighting
```markdown
# Adaptive Highlighting Based on Comprehension

## Beginner Level (High Contrast)
==Unity GameObject is the base class for all entities in a scene==
!!Components define the behavior and properties of GameObjects!!
??Transform component controls position, rotation, and scale??

## Intermediate Level (Medium Contrast)
==MonoBehaviour provides lifecycle methods for component scripting==
*GetComponent<T>() retrieves component references*
Performance considerations: cache frequently accessed components

## Advanced Level (Low Contrast)
Component composition enables flexible entity design
ECS architecture offers performance benefits for data-oriented design
Job System integration requires careful data management
```

#### Context-Aware Highlighting
```markdown
# Highlighting Adaptation by Learning Context

## Job Interview Preparation
==Technical concepts most likely to be asked==
!!Common Unity gotchas and best practices!!
??Performance optimization strategies employers value??

## Project Development
==Implementation-focused highlights==
*Practical code examples and patterns*
Performance and debugging considerations

## Skill Development
==Foundational concepts for building expertise==
*Progressive complexity in highlighted information*
Connections between different knowledge areas
```
