## 🔧 Obsidian-Specific Markdown Features

### Wiki-Style Linking System
```markdown
Basic Wiki Links:
[[Target Document]] - Links to document by name
[[Target Document|Display Text]] - Custom display text
[[Target Document#Heading]] - Link to specific section
[[Target Document#^block-id]] - Link to specific block

Advanced Linking Patterns:
[[2024-01-15 Daily Note]] - Date-based linking
[[MOC - Unity Development]] - Map of Content linking
[[Person/John Doe]] - Hierarchical organization
[[Concept - Object Oriented Programming]] - Concept-based linking

Cross-Vault Linking:
[[obsidian://open?vault=SecondVault&file=Document]] - External vault links
```

### Block References and Embedding
```markdown
Block Reference Creation:
This is an important concept that I want to reference later. ^important-concept

Block Reference Usage:
![[Source Document#^important-concept]] - Embed the referenced block
[[Source Document#^important-concept]] - Link to the referenced block

Heading References:
## Key Learning Point ^heading-ref

Reference the heading:
[[Document Name#^heading-ref]] - Direct heading link

File Embedding:
![[Complete Document]] - Embed entire document
![[Document#Specific Section]] - Embed specific section
![[Image.png|400]] - Embed image with size specification
```

### Advanced Tagging Strategies
```markdown
Hierarchical Tag System:
#programming/languages/csharp - Multi-level categorization
#status/in-progress - Status-based tagging
#type/concept - Content type classification
#priority/high - Priority-based organization

Tag Combinations for Filtering:
#unity #csharp #beginner - Multiple tags for precise filtering
#project/game-dev #status/active - Project and status tracking
#review/weekly #type/reflection - Review cycle management

Smart Tag Usage:
- Use consistent tag hierarchies across vault
- Implement tag naming conventions
