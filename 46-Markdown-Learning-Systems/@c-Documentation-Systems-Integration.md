    support: "Full"
    unique_features: ["Task lists", "@mentions", "Issue linking"]
    export_formats: ["HTML", "PDF", "Wiki"]
  
  obsidian:
    support: "Enhanced"  
    unique_features: ["Wiki links", "Block references", "Graph view"]
    export_formats: ["HTML", "PDF", "Publish"]
  
  notion:
    support: "Partial"
