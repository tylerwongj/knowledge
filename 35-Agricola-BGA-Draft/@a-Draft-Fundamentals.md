Round 2: Pass Direction B (7 cards â†’ 6 â†’ 5 â†’ 4 â†’ 3 â†’ 2 â†’ 1)
Total: 14 cards per player
```

## ðŸš€ Strategic Foundations

### Card Categories & Power Levels

**Occupations (Workers)**
- **Power Level**: Generally stronger, immediate board impact
- **Activation**: Played during game, provide ongoing benefits
- **Resource Cost**: Usually require specific resources to play
- **Strategic Value**: Higher variance, game-changing potential

**Minor Improvements (Infrastructure)**
- **Power Level**: Consistent value, incremental advantages
- **Activation**: Easier to play, lower resource requirements
- **Resource Cost**: Often just food or basic resources
- **Strategic Value**: More reliable, consistent scoring

### Draft Priority Framework

**Tier 1 (First Pick Quality)**
- Game-breaking Occupations with immediate impact
- High-value scoring engines
- Resource multiplication effects
- Cards that enable entire strategies

**Tier 2 (Strong Picks)**
- Solid value Occupations with good effects
- Efficient Minor Improvements
- Cards that support multiple strategies
- Good backup options for main strategy

**Tier 3 (Situational)**
- Niche cards for specific strategies
- Cards requiring heavy setup
- Late-game focused cards without early impact
- Cards dependent on other draft picks

## ðŸ’¡ Core Drafting Principles

### Early Draft Strategy (Picks 1-4)
1. **Power Maximization**: Take the highest impact cards available
2. **Strategy Flexibility**: Keep options open for multiple paths
3. **Resource Awareness**: Consider your starting resources
4. **Opponent Denial**: Cut powerful cards from opponents when equal

### Mid Draft Strategy (Picks 5-8)
1. **Strategy Commitment**: Begin focusing on chosen path
2. **Synergy Building**: Look for cards that work together
3. **Resource Planning**: Draft cards you can actually play
4. **Signal Reading**: Observe what's being passed

### Late Draft Strategy (Picks 9-14)
1. **Gap Filling**: Address weaknesses in your deck
2. **Efficiency Focus**: Take cards you can reliably play
3. **Scoring Optimization**: Prioritize cards that directly score points
4. **Hate Drafting**: Deny opponents key pieces when beneficial

## ðŸ”§ Advanced Draft Techniques

### Signal Reading
**Strong Signals:**
- High-quality cards appearing late in packs
- Multiple cards of similar strategy in one pack
- Absence of expected cards in late picks

**How to Respond:**
- **Open Lane**: Move into underdrafted strategies
- **Contested Lane**: Prepare backup plans
- **Cut Strategy**: Deny opponents their preferred cards

### Deck Composition Targets
**Optimal Balance:**
- **6-8 Occupations**: Higher risk/reward, game-changing effects
- **6-8 Minor Improvements**: Consistent value, easier to play
- **2-3 Engine Cards**: Core strategy enablers
- **4-5 Efficiency Cards**: Resource generation and conversion
- **4-5 Scoring Cards**: Direct point generation

### Resource Curve Planning
**Early Game (Rounds 1-5):**
- Focus on resource generation
- Play cheap Minor Improvements
- Build basic infrastructure

**Mid Game (Rounds 6-10):**
- Deploy key Occupations
- Establish scoring engines
- Optimize resource conversion

**Late Game (Rounds 11-14):**
- Maximize scoring output
- Play remaining high-value cards
- Focus on point generation

## ðŸš€ AI/LLM Integration Opportunities

### Draft Analysis Automation
```
Prompt: "Analyze this Agricola draft pack: [card list]. Consider my current deck: [deck composition]. What's the optimal pick and why? Include backup options and signal reading."
```

### Strategy Optimization
```
Prompt: "I've drafted these Agricola cards: [card list]. Generate an optimal play sequence for rounds 1-14, considering resource constraints and scoring priorities."
```

### Opponent Analysis
```
Prompt: "Based on these passed cards: [card list], what strategies are my opponents likely pursuing? How should I adjust my draft priorities?"
```

## ðŸ’¡ Key Strategic Insights

### Draft Adaptation Principles
1. **Flexibility > Stubbornness**: Adapt to draft signals rather than forcing strategies
2. **Power > Synergy**: Individual card power often trumps synergy in draft
3. **Playability > Potential**: Draft cards you can actually use
4. **Timing Matters**: Consider when cards come online vs. when you need them

### Common Draft Mistakes
- **Overdrafting Occupations**: Having too many high-cost cards
- **Ignoring Signals**: Forcing unavailable strategies
- **Poor Resource Planning**: Drafting unplayable cards
- **Neglecting Scoring**: Focusing on engines without point generation

### Meta Considerations
- **Player Count Effects**: Different strategies viable at different player counts
- **Board Setup Variation**: Draft priorities change with different boards
- **Time Pressure**: BGA timer affects draft decision quality
- **Experience Gaps**: Exploit less experienced drafters' mistakes

This foundational guide provides the framework for mastering Agricola draft on Board Game Arena. Success requires understanding both individual card evaluation and overall draft strategy, while remaining flexible enough to adapt to the unique circumstances of each draft.
