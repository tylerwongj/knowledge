- **Resource Engine**: Material generation for building/trading
- **Animal Engine**: Livestock breeding and management focus

**Value Archetypes** (Consistent point accumulation)  
- **Diverse Development**: Broad category completion with Village Elder
- **Specialist Focus**: Deep investment in specific scoring categories
- **Improvement Collection**: Minor Improvement point accumulation

**Tempo Archetypes** (Early game advantage conversion)
- **Fast Family Growth**: Early expansion into more workers
- **Resource Rush**: Quick accumulation of building materials
- **Action Efficiency**: Tool-focused action optimization

## ðŸš€ Food Engine Archetype

### Core Strategy
Build sustainable food production to enable maximum family growth and worker actions.

**Key Cards:**
- **Premium**: Wet Nurse, Grocer, Chief, Fireplace variants
- **Supporting**: Well, Cooking facilities, Grain/Vegetable sources
- **Enablers**: Plow, Grain seeds, Vegetable sources

**Draft Priorities:**
1. **P1-P3**: Secure premium food engine pieces
2. **P4-P7**: Add supporting infrastructure and redundancy  
3. **P8-P14**: Fill curve and add scoring elements

### Execution Pattern
```
Early (R1-5): Establish food production foundation
- Play Fireplace, establish grain/vegetable production
- Take Family Growth when food secure
- Build basic infrastructure

Mid (R6-10): Scale food engine and grow family
- Deploy Wet Nurse or premium food cards
- Take additional Family Growth actions
- Begin diversifying into scoring

Late (R11-14): Convert worker advantage to points
- Use extra actions for point generation
- Complete scoring categories
- Play remaining value cards
```

**Strengths:**
- High action count advantage
- Flexible execution paths
- Strong scaling potential
- Difficult to disrupt

**Weaknesses:**
- Vulnerable to food scarcity
- Requires early card commitment
- Can be slow to generate points
- Dependent on harvest timing

**Counter-strategies:**
- Contest family growth actions
- Draft away premium food cards
- Focus on efficient point generation
- Pressure early game tempo

## ðŸ’¡ Animal Engine Archetype

### Core Strategy
Build efficient animal breeding and management system for high-value scoring.

**Key Cards:**
- **Premium**: Animal breeding cards, Pasture enablers
- **Supporting**: Fencing, Stables, Animal-specific workers
- **Enablers**: Building materials for pastures

**Animal Priority Order:**
1. **Cattle**: 3 points each, highest individual value
2. **Wild Boar**: 2 points each, easier management
3. **Sheep**: 1 point each, space efficient

### Execution Pattern
```
Early (R1-5): Build pasture infrastructure
- Acquire building materials (Wood, Reed)
- Create initial pastures and fencing
- Establish food security for animal feeding

Mid (R6-10): Scale animal production
- Add breeding and expansion cards
- Create additional pasture space
- Begin acquiring high-value animals

Late (R11-14): Maximize animal points
- Fill all available pasture space
- Focus on cattle acquisition when possible
- Convert remaining resources to animals
```

**Strengths:**
- High point density per resource
- Clear execution path
- Strong late-game scaling
- Difficult to contest directly

**Weaknesses:**
- Requires significant infrastructure
- Vulnerable to pasture action blocking
- Limited by space constraints
- Needs consistent food for animals

## ðŸ”§ Diverse Development Archetype

### Core Strategy
Build balanced development across all categories to maximize Village Elder scoring bonus.

**Key Cards:**
- **Essential**: Village Elder (mandatory for archetype)
- **Supporting**: Cards that create new development types
- **Enablers**: Resource generation for diverse building

**Development Categories:**
```
Target Categories (7+ for maximum bonus):
- Grain Fields (plant grain)
- Pastures (build fencing)
- Clay Huts (starting rooms)
- Family Members (family growth)
- Grain (harvest/acquire)
- Vegetables (plant/acquire)  
- Animals (sheep/boar/cattle)
```

### Execution Pattern
```
Early (R1-5): Establish foundation across categories
- Create initial grain field and pasture
- Build basic infrastructure
- Begin resource diversification

Mid (R6-10): Deploy Village Elder and scale diversity
- Play Village Elder as soon as practical
- Add new development categories systematically
- Balance breadth with depth

Late (R11-14): Complete remaining categories
- Fill any missing development types
- Optimize existing categories for points
- Play remaining value cards
```

**Strengths:**
- High scoring ceiling with Village Elder
- Resilient to disruption
- Multiple scoring paths
- Flexible execution

**Weaknesses:**
- Entirely dependent on Village Elder
- Can be inefficient without multiplier
- Requires broad resource access
- Vulnerable to Village Elder denial

## ðŸš€ Fast Family Growth Archetype

### Core Strategy
Prioritize early family expansion to gain action economy advantage throughout the game.

**Key Cards:**
- **Essential**: Wet Nurse, early food generation
- **Supporting**: Cheap food sources, cooking facilities
- **Enablers**: Family Growth action access

**Growth Timeline:**
```
Optimal Expansion:
Round 1-2: Establish food foundation
Round 4-5: First Family Growth (3â†’4 family)
Round 7-8: Second Family Growth (4â†’5 family)  
Round 10-11: Potential third growth if resources allow
```

### Execution Pattern
```
Early (R1-5): Rush to first family growth
- Prioritize food security above all else
- Take Family Growth as soon as viable
- Build minimal infrastructure initially

Mid (R6-10): Leverage action advantage
- Use extra actions for accelerated development
- Continue expanding family when possible
- Begin transitioning to scoring focus

Late (R11-14): Convert actions to points
- Use action advantage for point generation
- Complete scoring categories efficiently
- Play remaining cards for value
```

**Strengths:**
- Significant action economy advantage
- Scales well throughout game
- Multiple strategic options
- Hard to match tempo

**Weaknesses:**
- Extremely food dependent
- Vulnerable to family growth blocking
- Requires precise timing
- Can struggle with resource scarcity

## ðŸ’¡ Counter-Archetype Strategies

### Anti-Engine Tactics
**Food Engine Counters:**
- Draft premium food cards away from engine players
- Contest Family Growth actions aggressively
- Focus on efficient point generation to match scaling
- Pressure early game when engines are weak

**Animal Engine Counters:**
- Take building materials needed for pastures
- Contest animal-related actions
- Focus on non-animal scoring categories
- Pressure tempo while they build infrastructure

### Meta-Game Adaptation
**When Engines Dominate:**
- Draft more disruption and tempo cards
- Focus on consistent value strategies
- Prioritize early game pressure
- Build decks that don't require specific setups

**When Value Strategies Dominate:**
- Look for undervalued engine pieces
- Take calculated risks on setup-dependent strategies
- Focus on scaling potential over immediate value
- Exploit longer-term thinking gaps
