### Unity-Specific Agile Practices
```markdown
# Game Development Sprint Planning

## Technical Debt Integration
- **Definition of Done**: Includes code review, testing, and technical debt assessment
- **Technical Debt Stories**: Dedicated stories for refactoring and optimization
- **Performance Budgets**: Frame rate and memory constraints as acceptance criteria
- **Platform Testing**: Cross-platform verification as part of sprint goals

## Feature Development Workflow
1. **Design Phase**: Mockups, technical feasibility analysis
2. **Prototyping**: Rapid Unity prototype to validate concepts
3. **Implementation**: Full feature development with testing
4. **Integration**: Cross-system integration and testing
5. **Polish**: Performance optimization and UX refinement

## Cross-Disciplinary Coordination
- **Art Pipeline Integration**: Asset delivery schedules aligned with development sprints
- **Audio Implementation**: Sound integration milestones within development cycles
- **QA Collaboration**: Testing integration throughout sprint, not just at end
```

### Agile Estimation for Game Features
```python
# Game Development Estimation Framework
estimation_techniques = {
    "story_points": {
        "technical_complexity": [
            "1 point: Simple UI update or parameter adjustment",
            "3 points: New component or simple system implementation", 
            "5 points: Complex system integration or optimization",
            "8 points: Major architectural changes or new subsystems",
            "13 points: Cross-platform feature with significant unknowns"
        ],
        
        "uncertainty_factors": [
            "New Unity features or packages",
            "Cross-platform compatibility requirements",
            "Performance optimization needs",
            "Art pipeline integration complexity",
            "Third-party SDK integration challenges"
        ]
    },
    
    "planning_poker_adaptations": {
        "technical_considerations": [

- Identify cross-disciplinary dependencies (art, audio, design)
- Estimate effort with uncertainty ranges
- Plan technical debt and optimization work

## Daily Standups (15 minutes, developer-focused)
**Yesterday**: Specific technical progress, not just "worked on feature"
**Today**: Clear deliverable commitments with potential technical blockers
**Blockers**: Technical obstacles with investigation approaches planned
**Dependencies**: What you need from other disciplines or external teams

## Sprint Review (2 hours, demo-focused)
- Playable build demonstration with stakeholder feedback
- Performance metrics and technical achievement showcase
- Cross-platform compatibility verification
- Player experience validation and iteration planning

## Sprint Retrospective (1.5 hours, improvement-focused)

```

### **Agile Anti-Patterns in Game Development**
```yaml
Common Pitfalls and Solutions:
  Anti-Pattern: "Crunch Sprint Planning"
    Problem: Planning features under deadline pressure without proper analysis
    Solution: Maintain realistic velocity tracking and buffer planning for unknowns

  Anti-Pattern: "Feature Factory Mentality"  
    Problem: Prioritizing new features over technical debt and code quality
    Solution: Allocate 20-30% of sprint capacity to technical improvement work

  Anti-Pattern: "Silo Development"
    Problem: Developers working in isolation without cross-functional collaboration
    Solution: Include cross-disciplinary acceptance criteria in user stories

  Anti-Pattern: "Demo-Driven Development"
    Problem: Focusing on demo-ready features rather than sustainable development
    Solution: Balance stakeholder communication with long-term technical health

  Anti-Pattern: "Estimation Gaming"
    Problem: Inflating estimates to create buffer time or meet velocity expectations
    Solution: Focus on relative sizing and track actual completion patterns
```

    }
    
    // Technical Debt Management
    private void ManageTechnicalDebtInSprints()
    {
        // Allocate specific percentage of sprint to technical improvement
        // Create technical debt stories with clear business impact
        // Track technical debt accumulation vs resolution rates
        // Communicate technical debt impact to product stakeholders
    }
    
    // Cross-Functional Collaboration
    private void FacilitateCrossFunctionalWork()
    {
        // Include art and design constraints in technical planning
        // Create shared understanding of technical limitations
        // Facilitate early integration of assets and features
        // Establish clear communication channels for technical questions

- UI/UX Team (interface, user experience)
- Platform Team (performance, deployment)
- Content Team (levels, assets, progression)

**Coordination Patterns:**
- Weekly Scrum of Scrums with technical representatives
- Shared Definition of Done across all teams
- Integrated testing and build pipeline
- Cross-team technical debt and architecture planning

## Feature Team vs Component Team Balance
**Feature Teams:** Cross-functional teams owning complete player-facing features
