    - Non-destructive editing capabilities
    - Greater dynamic range preservation
    - Superior color depth (12-14 bit vs. 8 bit)
    - Professional workflow standard

  JPEG Considerations:
    - Smaller file sizes
    - Ready for immediate sharing
    - Limited editing flexibility
    - Compression artifacts with heavy editing
    - 8-bit color depth limitation

File Format Selection:
  RAW + JPEG: Best of both worlds
  RAW Only: Maximum editing flexibility
  JPEG Fine: Quick turnaround projects
  TIFF: Archival and print preparation
```
