  Down Arrow: Go to next edit point
  Page Up: Go to previous marker
  Page Down: Go to next marker

Zoom Controls:
  Shift + Z: Fit timeline to window width
  Cmd/Ctrl + =: Zoom in timeline
  Cmd/Ctrl + -: Zoom out timeline
  Shift + Cmd/Ctrl + Z: Zoom to selection

Playhead Movement:
  I: Set In point
  O: Set Out point
  X: Clear In/Out points
  G: Go to timecode (opens dialog)
```

### Advanced Navigation Techniques
```yaml
Speed Ramping:
  J J J: 3x reverse speed
  L L L: 3x forward speed
  K + J: Slow reverse scrubbing
  K + L: Slow forward scrubbing

Selection & Marking:
  M: Add marker at playhead
  Shift + M: Add marker with notes
  Cmd/Ctrl + M: Delete marker at playhead
  Alt + M: Delete all markers

Range Selection:
  Shift + I: Extend selection to In point
  Shift + O: Extend selection to Out point
  Alt + X: Select all clips in timeline
  Cmd/Ctrl + A: Select all in current track
```

## ðŸš€ AI/LLM Integration Opportunities

### Custom Shortcut Generation
```yaml
AI-Powered Shortcut Optimization:
  - Analyze editing patterns to suggest optimal shortcuts
  - Generate custom shortcut schemes based on project type
  - Create context-aware shortcut suggestions
  - Automate shortcut conflict resolution

Smart Macro Creation:
  - Record and optimize repetitive navigation sequences
  - AI-generated macros for common editing patterns
  - Intelligent shortcut chaining for complex operations
  - Adaptive shortcuts that change based on timeline context
```

### Workflow Intelligence
```yaml
Navigation Pattern Learning:
  - Track most-used navigation commands
  - Suggest workflow optimizations based on usage data
  - Automated shortcut training recommendations
  - Performance analytics for navigation efficiency
```

## ðŸ’¡ Advanced Navigation Strategies

### 1. Layered Navigation Approach
```yaml
Macro Level (Project Overview):
  - Timeline zoom out for full project view
  - Jump between major sections using markers
  - Use thumbnail scrubbing for rapid content scanning

Micro Level (Precise Editing):
  - Frame-by-frame navigation with arrow keys
  - Audio waveform scrubbing for sync precision
  - Slip/slide tools for fine-tuning without timeline movement
```

### 2. Context-Specific Shortcuts
```yaml
Color Grading Navigation:
  - Still mode (K) for stable preview
  - Before/After comparison shortcuts
  - Clip isolation for focused grading work

Audio Editing Navigation:
  - Audio-only playback shortcuts
  - Waveform zoom controls
  - Audio scrubbing with pitch preservation
```

### 3. Multi-Track Navigation
```yaml
Track Management:
  V1, V2, V3: Toggle video track visibility
  A1, A2, A3: Toggle audio track visibility
  Shift + V1: Solo video track 1
  Alt + Track: Lock/unlock track

Vertical Navigation:
  Cmd/Ctrl + Up: Move selection up one track
  Cmd/Ctrl + Down: Move selection down one track
  Tab: Cycle through tracks
```

## ðŸ”§ Custom Shortcut Optimization

### Personal Shortcut Mapping
```yaml
High-Frequency Operations:
  - Map most-used functions to single-key shortcuts
  - Use modifier combinations for related functions
  - Group similar operations under same base key

Ergonomic Considerations:
  - Keep frequent shortcuts near home row
  - Use logical key groupings (QWERTY proximity)
  - Minimize hand movement for common operations
```

### DaVinci Resolve Customization
```yaml
Keyboard Customization Path:
  DaVinci Resolve > Keyboard Customization
  
Priority Customizations:
  - Blade tool: B (for quick cuts)
  - Selection tool: V (return to selection)
  - Speed ramping: Custom J/K/L variations
  - Marker shortcuts: Personalized marker workflow

Export/Import Shortcuts:
  - Save custom layouts as .xml files
  - Share optimized shortcuts across systems
  - Version control for shortcut configurations
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Muscle Memory Development

### Training Progression
```yaml
Week 1-2: Basic Navigation
  - Master J/K/L playback controls
  - Practice arrow key frame navigation
  - Learn In/Out point setting (I/O keys)

Week 3-4: Advanced Movement
  - Speed ramping with multiple J/L presses
  - Edit point jumping (Up/Down arrows)
  - Zoom controls (Shift+Z, Cmd/Ctrl +/-)

Week 5-6: Complex Operations
  - Marker workflows (M key variations)
  - Track management shortcuts
  - Selection and range operations
```

### Practice Exercises
```yaml
Daily Drills:
  1. Timeline Overview: Start->End->Fit to window (5 reps)
  2. Precision Navigation: Find specific timecode using G key
  3. Speed Scrubbing: Use J/K/L to locate specific moments
  4. Edit Point Practice: Jump between cuts using arrows

Weekly Challenges:
  - Complete rough cut using only keyboard shortcuts
  - Navigate complex timeline without mouse usage
  - Time yourself performing common navigation tasks
```
