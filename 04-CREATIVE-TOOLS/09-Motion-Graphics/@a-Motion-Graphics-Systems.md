## üé¨ Motion Graphics Fundamentals

### Principles of Animation and Motion Design
```yaml
12 Principles of Animation:
  Squash and Stretch:
    - Gives weight and flexibility to objects
    - Exaggerates motion for believability
    - Maintains volume during deformation
    - Essential for character animation

  Anticipation:
    - Prepares audience for main action
    - Makes actions more realistic
    - Creates dramatic tension
    - Guides viewer attention

  Staging:
    - Clear presentation of ideas
    - Proper composition and framing
    - Focus on important elements
    - Effective use of contrast

  Straight Ahead vs. Pose-to-Pose:
    - Straight ahead: Frame-by-frame animation
    - Pose-to-pose: Key poses with in-betweens
    - Each method has specific applications
    - Often combined for best results

  Follow Through and Overlapping Action:
    - Different parts move at different rates
    - Creates more realistic motion
    - Adds secondary animation
    - Prevents stiff, mechanical movement
```

### Typography in Motion
```yaml
Kinetic Typography Principles:
  Readability in Motion:
    - Sufficient contrast and size
    - Appropriate timing for reading
    - Clear hierarchy and emphasis
    - Consistent spacing and kerning

  Text Animation Techniques:
    - Letter-by-letter reveals
    - Word or line-based animations
    - Morphing and transformation effects
    - Path-based text movement

  Typography Hierarchy:
    - Primary: Main message (largest, most prominent)
    - Secondary: Supporting information
    - Tertiary: Details and fine print
    - Consistent visual language

Brand Integration:
  - Font choice reflects brand personality
  - Color schemes align with brand guidelines
