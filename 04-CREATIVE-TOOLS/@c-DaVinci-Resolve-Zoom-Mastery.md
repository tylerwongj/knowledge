```

## ðŸš€ AI/LLM Integration for Resolve Workflows

### Automated Resolve Script Generation
```prompt
Generate a DaVinci Resolve script for automated zoom effects:

Project Type: [corporate video/music video/documentary]
Timeline Duration: [total length]
Zoom Style: [subtle/dramatic/rhythmic]
Audio Sync: [yes/no, if yes provide BPM]

Create Lua script that:
- Identifies optimal zoom points
- Applies consistent zoom curves
- Sets appropriate keyframe timing
- Maintains project color grading standards
```

### Resolve-Specific Zoom Optimization
```python
# Python script for Resolve API integration
import DaVinciResolveScript as dvr_script

def optimize_zoom_performance(timeline):
    resolve = dvr_script.scriptapp("Resolve")
    project = resolve.GetProjectManager().GetCurrentProject()
    
    # Analyze zoom-heavy clips
    zoom_clips = identify_zoom_clips(timeline)
    
    # Apply optimization strategies
    for clip in zoom_clips:
        # Enable optimized media if zoom > 150%
        if get_max_zoom(clip) > 1.5:
            clip.SetClipProperty("Super Scale", "1")
        
        # Pre-render complex zoom sequences
        if get_zoom_complexity(clip) > threshold:
            add_to_render_queue(clip)
```

### Color-Aware Zoom Automation
```prompt
Analyze this DaVinci Resolve project for color-consistent zoom automation:

Color Grading Style: [natural/cinematic/commercial/artistic]
Primary Correction Nodes: [list of corrections applied]
Zoom Intensity Range: [100%-200% typical scale]
Footage Characteristics: [resolution, format, lighting conditions]

Provide automation strategy that:
- Maintains color consistency during zoom
- Preserves skin tones and brand colors
- Optimizes for Resolve's color pipeline
- Integrates with existing node structure
```

## ðŸ’¡ Resolve Performance Optimization

### GPU Acceleration for Zoom Effects
```
Optimization Settings:
- Enable GPU acceleration in preferences
- Use CUDA/OpenCL for transform processing
- Allocate sufficient VRAM for zoom operations
- Monitor GPU usage during playback

GPU Memory Management:
