# e-Audio Scrubbing Techniques

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
- Master audio-specific scrubbing techniques for precise audio editing
- Understand pitch preservation vs speed scrubbing for different audio content
- Implement advanced audio sync and timing workflows
- Optimize audio scrubbing settings for various content types

## ðŸ”§ Audio Scrubbing Fundamentals

### Audio Scrubbing Types
```yaml
Pitch-Preserved Scrubbing:
  - Maintains original pitch during speed changes
  - Best for: Dialogue, vocals, musical content
  - Use when: Content intelligibility is critical
  - Trade-off: Slightly less smooth scrubbing experience

Speed-Based Scrubbing:
  - Changes pitch with speed (traditional tape-style)
  - Best for: Sound effects, ambient audio, sync work
  - Use when: Precise timing identification needed
  - Benefit: More natural scrubbing feel for timing work
```
