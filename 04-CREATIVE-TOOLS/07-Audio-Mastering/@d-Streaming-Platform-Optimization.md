### Understanding Loudness Normalization
```yaml
How Normalization Works:
  Algorithm Process:
    - Platform analyzes uploaded audio
    - Measures integrated loudness (LUFS)
    - Applies gain adjustment to match target
    - Preserves relative dynamics within track
    - Never exceeds original peak levels

  Impact on Mastering:
    - Louder masters may be turned down
    - Quieter masters may be turned up
    - Dynamic range is preserved
    - Peak limiting becomes less critical
    - Musical dynamics become more important

User Control Options:
  Spotify Normalization:
    - Loud: -11 LUFS (aggressive limiting beneficial)
    - Normal: -14 LUFS (balanced approach)
    - Quiet: -23 LUFS (preserve dynamics)

  Apple Sound Check:
    - iOS: Automatic normalization
    - macOS: User-controllable
    - Variable target based on content

  Platform Differences:
    - Some users disable normalization
    - Mobile vs. desktop differences
    - Headphone vs. speaker optimization
    - User preference variations
```
