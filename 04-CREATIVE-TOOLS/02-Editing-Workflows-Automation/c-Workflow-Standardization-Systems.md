- **Reference Materials**: Style guides, client assets, inspiration

## Technical Preparation
- Proxy generation for 4K+ footage
- Audio sync and timecode alignment
- Color space and gamma tag verification
- File naming convention application

## Quality Control Checkpoint #1
- [ ] All assets properly named and organized
- [ ] Proxy files generated and linked

3. **Content Placement**: Position key moments and transitions
4. **Audio Foundation**: Basic dialogue edit and music placement

## Consistency Checkpoints
- Cut timing aligned with established pacing guidelines
- Story flow matches approved outline
- Audio levels roughly balanced (-18dB dialogue baseline)
- No technical issues (dropped frames, sync problems)

## Quality Control Checkpoint #2
- [ ] Story structure complete and approved

2. **Audio Mastering**: Final loudness and EQ optimization
3. **Graphics Finish**: Final typography and animation polish
4. **Transition Smoothing**: Perfect all transitions and effects
5. **Quality Assurance**: Complete technical review

## Final Consistency Check
- Overall visual coherence across entire project
- Audio consistency and professional loudness standards
- Brand compliance and style guide adherence
- Technical delivery requirements met

## Quality Control Checkpoint #4
- [ ] Complete playthrough with no technical issues
- [ ] Color grading enhances and unifies footage
- [ ] Audio mastered to delivery specifications
- [ ] All graphics and text error-free
- [ ] Export settings configured correctly
```

#### Stage 5: Delivery Preparation (5% of timeline)
```markdown
## Export and Delivery
1. **Technical QC**: Final technical review
2. **Export Execution**: Render final deliverables
3. **Quality Verification**: Post-export quality check
4. **Asset Archival**: Project backup and organization
5. **Client Delivery**: Structured handoff process
```
