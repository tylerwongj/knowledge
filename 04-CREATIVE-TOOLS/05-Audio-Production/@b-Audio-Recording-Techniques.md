# @b-Audio-Recording-Techniques - Professional Audio Capture & Setup

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

- Master professional audio recording techniques for content creation
- Implement optimal microphone selection and placement strategies
- Design acoustically treated recording environments on any budget
- Optimize audio capture workflows for consistency and quality

## ðŸ”§ Microphone Selection & Setup

### Microphone Types and Use Cases
```
Dynamic Microphones:
- Shure SM7B: Broadcast standard, excellent for vocals
- Electro-Voice RE20: Radio/podcast industry standard
- Shure SM58: Live performance, durable, feedback resistant
- Use Cases: Loud environments, live recording, untreated rooms

Condenser Microphones:
- Audio-Technica AT2020: Entry-level studio condenser
- Rode PodMic: Purpose-built for podcasting
- Neumann U87: Industry standard for professional vocals
- Use Cases: Studio environments, detailed vocal capture, quiet spaces

USB vs XLR:
- USB: Plug-and-play, built-in preamp, limited upgradeability
- XLR: Professional standard, requires audio interface, more flexible
- Recommendation: Start USB, upgrade to XLR as skills develop
```

### Microphone Placement Techniques
```
Vocal Recording Placement:
Distance: 6-12 inches from mouth
Angle: Slightly off-axis to reduce plosives
Height: Microphone capsule at mouth level
Pop Filter: 4-6 inches between mouth and microphone

Room Tone Considerations:
- Record in the quietest room available
- Avoid hard surfaces that create reflections
- Use soft furnishings to absorb sound
- Record away from computer fans and HVAC systems

Proximity Effect Management:
- Closer = more bass response
- Maintain consistent distance for even tone
- Use high-pass filter if too much bass
- Practice maintaining position while speaking
```

### Audio Interface Configuration
```
Entry Level Interfaces:
- Focusrite Scarlett Solo/2i2: Great starter option
- PreSonus AudioBox USB 96: Budget-friendly alternative
- Zoom PodTrak P4: Podcast-specific interface

Professional Interfaces:
- Focusrite Scarlett 18i8: Multiple inputs/outputs
- Universal Audio Apollo Twin: Built-in DSP processing
- RME Babyface Pro FS: Pristine audio quality

Input Gain Settings:
- Set input gain to peak around -12dB to -6dB
- Avoid clipping (red indicators)
- Leave headroom for post-processing
- Use input monitoring to hear yourself clearly
```

## ðŸŽ® Recording Environment Optimization

### Acoustic Treatment on a Budget
```
DIY Acoustic Solutions:
- Moving blankets as portable vocal booths
- Thick curtains to reduce reflections
- Bookshelves filled with books as diffusers
- Rugs and soft furniture to absorb sound

Professional Treatment:
- Acoustic foam panels for first reflection points
- Bass traps in room corners
- Reflection filters behind microphone
- Isolation shields around microphone

Recording Space Selection:
- Closets full of clothes work well
- Avoid bathrooms (too much reverb)
- Test clap test: minimal echo is ideal
- Record in different locations to compare
```

### Signal Chain Optimization
```
Optimal Signal Path:
Microphone â†’ Pop Filter â†’ Audio Interface â†’ Computer

Monitoring Chain:
Audio Interface â†’ Headphones/Monitors
- Use closed-back headphones for recording
- Monitor at comfortable levels (not too loud)
- Check for latency issues in software

Gain Staging:
1. Set microphone gain first
2. Adjust interface input level
3. Set software recording level
4. Monitor output level for comfortable listening
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Recording Workflow Best Practices

### Pre-Recording Preparation
```
Technical Checklist:
â–¡ Test microphone and interface connectivity
â–¡ Set appropriate input levels
â–¡ Configure recording software settings
â–¡ Test headphone monitoring
â–¡ Record short test to verify quality

Environmental Checklist:
â–¡ Turn off fans, air conditioning, appliances
â–¡ Close windows to reduce outside noise
â–¡ Silence phone notifications
â–¡ Inform others you're recording
â–¡ Have water nearby (stay hydrated)

Content Preparation:
â–¡ Script or outline ready
â–¡ Practice difficult pronunciations
â–¡ Warm up voice with exercises
â–¡ Plan for breaks in longer sessions
â–¡ Have backup power for devices
```

### Recording Session Management
```
Recording Techniques:
- Record in segments for easier editing
- Leave 2-3 seconds of silence at beginning
- Record room tone (30 seconds of "silence")
- Take multiple takes of difficult sections
- Note timestamp of good takes during recording

File Management:
- Use descriptive file names with dates
- Save projects and raw files separately
- Create backup copies immediately
- Document session notes and settings
- Export reference copies for review

Quality Control:
- Monitor audio levels throughout session
- Check for background noise regularly
- Listen back to early recordings during session
- Adjust microphone position if needed
- Record alternate takes for options
```

### Multi-Track Recording Strategies
```
Podcast/Interview Setup:
- Separate tracks for each speaker
- Use individual microphones when possible
- Monitor each speaker's levels independently
- Record backup safety track at lower level

Music/Complex Audio:
- Layer instruments/vocals on separate tracks
- Use click track/metronome for timing
- Record reference guide track first
- Plan arrangement before recording

Remote Recording:
- Use tools like SquadCast or Riverside
- Have local backup recordings
- Test connection and quality beforehand
- Use high-quality internet connection
- Have backup communication method
```

## ðŸ“Š Recording Software Configuration

### DAW Setup for Recording
```
Recommended DAWs:
Free Options:
- Audacity: Simple, cross-platform
- GarageBand: Mac only, user-friendly
- Reaper: 60-day free trial, then affordable

Professional Options:
- Pro Tools: Industry standard
- Logic Pro: Mac-based professional DAW
- Adobe Audition: Part of Creative Cloud

Recording Settings:
Sample Rate: 44.1kHz or 48kHz
Bit Depth: 24-bit minimum
Buffer Size: 128-256 samples (lower = less latency)
File Format: WAV for highest quality
```

### Monitoring and Recording Setup
```
Software Configuration:
- Enable input monitoring for real-time feedback
- Set up separate headphone mix if available
- Use hardware monitoring when possible (lower latency)
- Configure metronome/click track if needed

Recording Parameters:
- Create templates with standard settings
- Set up track colors and naming conventions
- Configure automatic punch-in/out points
- Set up keyboard shortcuts for common tasks

Quality Assurance:
- Record test samples before main session
- Check phase alignment for multiple microphones
- Verify stereo imaging if using stereo recording
- Monitor for digital clipping and distortion
