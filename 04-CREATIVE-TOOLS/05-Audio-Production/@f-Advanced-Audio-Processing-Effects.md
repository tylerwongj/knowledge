### Dynamic Range Processing
```yaml
Compressor Types:
  - VCA: Clean, transparent compression for vocals/instruments
  - Optical: Smooth, musical compression for program material
  - FET: Fast, punchy compression for drums/transients
  - Tube: Warm, harmonic saturation with compression
  - Digital: Precise control, surgical compression

Multi-band Compression:
  - Low: 20-250 Hz (bass control, mud reduction)
  - Mid: 250-4000 Hz (presence, clarity, vocal intelligibility)
  - High: 4000+ Hz (air, brightness, sibilance control)
  
Parallel Compression:
  - Blend: 20-40% compressed signal with dry signal
  - Purpose: Maintain dynamics while adding punch/sustain
  - Applications: Drums, vocals, full mix enhancement
```
