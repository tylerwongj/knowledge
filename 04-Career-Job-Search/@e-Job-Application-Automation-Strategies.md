        ]
    },
    "resume": {
        "sections_to_adapt": [
            "professional_summary",
            "technical_skills_ordering",
            "project_highlights",
            "achievement_quantification"
        ]
    }
}

# Prompt Engineering for Applications
def generate_cover_letter_prompt(job_description, company_info):
    return f"""
    Create a cover letter for a Unity Developer position based on:
    Job Description: {job_description}
    Company Research: {company_info}
    
    Requirements:
    - Highlight relevant Unity projects without overstating
    - Match technical keywords naturally
    - Show genuine interest in company's games/mission
    - Keep under 250 words, professional but personable tone
    - Include subtle productivity/efficiency hints without mentioning AI

- Cover letter variant A/B testing
- Resume format effectiveness analysis
- Follow-up timing optimization
```

## ðŸ’¡ Key Highlights

### **Stealth Automation Principles**
```yaml
Golden Rules:
- Never mention AI tools in applications or interviews
- Frame efficiency as "systematic approach" or "process optimization"
- Always add human touch to final outputs
- Maintain consistent voice across all materials
- Use AI for research and drafting, humans for final approval

Detection Avoidance:
- Vary writing style between applications
- Include occasional minor imperfections
- Reference specific details that require human research
- Use conversational language patterns
- Maintain authentic personality markers
```

    G --> H[Follow-up Sequence]
    H --> I[Relationship Building]
```

### **Resume Adaptation Strategy**
```yaml
Dynamic Sections:
  Technical Skills:
    - Reorder based on job requirements
    - Emphasize relevant Unity subsystems
    - Include specific C# patterns mentioned
    - Match architectural preferences
  
  Project Descriptions:
    - Select most relevant 3-4 projects
    - Customize technical details for audience
    - Quantify impact when possible
    - Align with company's game genres

  Professional Summary:
    - Mirror company culture language
    - Emphasize matching experience level
    - Include subtle efficiency/productivity hints
    - Reference specific technologies mentioned
```

### **Follow-up Automation System**
```python
# Strategic Follow-up Timeline
follow_up_sequence = {
    "day_3": "Thank you note with additional relevant portfolio piece",
    "day_7": "Share relevant Unity article with personal insight",
    "day_14": "LinkedIn connection request with personalized note",
    "day_21": "Soft check-in with value-add (not just status request)",
    "day_30": "Final follow-up with alternative collaboration suggestion"
}

# AI-Generated Follow-up Content
def generate_follow_up(stage, company_context, application_details):
    prompts = {
        "thank_you": "Create a brief thank you email that references specific details from the job posting and includes a relevant portfolio link.",
        "value_add": "Generate a follow-up that shares a relevant Unity development insight without being pushy about the application status.",
        "connection_request": "Write a LinkedIn connection request that references the application but focuses on industry networking value."
    }
```

## ðŸŽ® Unity-Specific Application Tactics

### Portfolio Integration Strategy
```markdown
# Technical Demonstration Approach

## Interactive Portfolio Elements
- WebGL builds embedded in personal website
- GitHub repositories with detailed README documentation
- Video walkthroughs of complex systems
- Technical blog posts explaining implementation choices

## Role-Specific Portfolio Curation
- Mobile Game Studios: Focus on performance optimization examples
- VR/AR Companies: Highlight spatial interaction systems  
- Indie Studios: Show versatility and full-stack capabilities
- Enterprise/Serious Games: Emphasize UX and accessibility features
```

### Technical Assessment Preparation
```yaml
Common Unity Interview Challenges:
- Object pooling implementation
- Coroutine vs async/await usage patterns
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Component-based architecture design
- Platform-specific considerations

AI-Assisted Preparation:
- Generate practice problems with solutions
- Create explanation templates for common concepts
- Develop portfolio project talking points
- Practice technical communication skills
```

### Network-Based Application Strategy
```yaml
Warm Introduction Paths:
1. Unity meetup organizers â†’ company developers
2. Former colleagues â†’ hiring managers  
3. Open source contributors â†’ technical leads
4. Conference speakers â†’ decision makers
5. LinkedIn mutual connections â†’ internal referrals

Relationship Building Automation:
- Track interaction history with potential referrers
- Generate conversation starters based on shared interests
- Monitor for mutual connection opportunities
- Create value-first outreach sequences
```

This system transforms job applications from time-consuming manual work into a strategic, data-driven process that maximizes opportunities while maintaining authentic human connection.
