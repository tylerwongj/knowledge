# AI-Powered Knowledge Testing System - Complete Implementation Guide

## üéØ Overview

The AI-Powered Knowledge Testing System is a comprehensive tool that transforms your knowledge repository into an interactive testing environment. It extracts questions from your TERMS.md files and other learning materials, then evaluates your answers using a hybrid approach combining keyword matching, local LLM evaluation, and optional API fallback.

ollama run mixtral:8x7b "Hello"
```

#### No Questions Generated
- Verify TERMS.md exists in target folder
- Check folder permissions
- Try with `--questions 5` for smaller test

#### Low Evaluation Scores
- Review expected answers in TERMS.md
- Use `--focus-areas` for specific topics
- Try easier difficulty first

#### Performance Issues
- Monitor RAM usage during local LLM evaluation
- Reduce batch size in config.yaml
- Use API fallback for complex questions

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable verbose output
python topic-tester.py ../26-Bible/ --questions 3 --verbose

# Test individual components
python question-generator.py ../26-Bible/ 3
python answer-evaluator.py
```
