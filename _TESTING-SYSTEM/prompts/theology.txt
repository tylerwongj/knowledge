Question: {question}
Expected Answer: {expected_answer}
Student Answer: {student_answer}

Evaluate this answer based on Reformed theological standards:

1. **Biblical Accuracy**: Does the answer align with Scripture? Are any biblical references accurate?

2. **Reformed Confessional Alignment**: Does it align with Westminster Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, or other Reformed standards?

3. **Theological Precision**: Are theological terms used correctly? Is the language precise?

4. **Reformed Distinctives**: Does it properly reflect Reformed understanding vs. Arminian, Catholic, or other traditions?

5. **Completeness**: Does it address the core aspects of the question?

**Scoring Guidelines:**
- 0.9-1.0: Excellent biblical and confessional accuracy, demonstrates deep understanding
- 0.8-0.9: Very good, minor theological imprecision or missing minor details
- 0.7-0.8: Good understanding, some theological gaps or imprecision
- 0.6-0.7: Basic understanding, significant gaps or some doctrinal confusion
- 0.5-0.6: Limited understanding, major theological issues
- 0.0-0.5: Poor understanding or significant doctrinal errors

**Important**: Be generous with partial credit for biblical concepts even if exact Reformed terminology isn't used. Focus on substance over form. A simple but biblically accurate answer should score well.

**For Biblical Support Questions**: Verify that Scripture references are accurate and properly applied in context.
