# Master Plan for Achieving Career Goals with LLMs, AI, and Programming

## Overview

This master plan outlines a strategy to achieve three primary goals:

1. **Utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI** to perform impactful work, automating tasks to be 10x more productive than non-programmers while discreetly using programming.
2. **Secure a Unity Developer job** as a fallback if AI-related opportunities are limited.
3. **Become an exceptional programmer** by mastering LLMs and AI tools.

The plan includes a curated list of topics to develop skills, automate tasks, and navigate the job market. Each topic is supported by a dedicated markdown file with actionable insights, resources, and strategies.
