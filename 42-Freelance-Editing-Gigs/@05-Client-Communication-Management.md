I love your new ideas for the project! The additional [specific request] would be a great enhancement.

This would be considered outside our original scope, so here's how we can handle it:

Option 2: Complete current project as planned, handle this as separate project
Option 3: Replace existing element with new request (timeline impact: X days)

Which approach works best for you?

Best,
[Your Name]"
```

## 🚨 Handling Difficult Situations

### Common Client Challenges

**Late Payment Handling:**

Day 30: Account placed with collection agency
```

**Unreasonable Revision Requests:**
```
Revision Limit Communication:
"Hi [Client Name],

I understand you'd like additional changes to the project. We've completed [X] revision rounds, which matches what's included in our agreement.

I'm happy to make additional revisions at my hourly rate of $[X]/hour. Based on your request, I estimate this would take [X] hours.

Would you like me to proceed with a separate invoice for these changes?

Best,
[Your Name]"
```

**Dissatisfied Client Recovery:**

2. Acknowledge their frustration professionally

6. Document all communications
7. Learn from feedback to prevent future issues
```

- Offer multiple resolution options when possible
- Set realistic timelines for problem resolution
- Follow up promptly on all commitments made
