# @04-Hebrew-Greek-Word-Studies - Original Language Foundations

## üéØ Learning Objectives
- Master systematic approach to Hebrew and Greek word studies
- Understand original language tools without requiring fluency
- Apply lexical analysis to enhance biblical interpretation
- Avoid common word study errors and fallacies

## üìñ ==Original Language== Foundation

### ==Why Study Original Languages?==
**R.C. Sproul**: "The original languages are the foundation for accurate biblical interpretation. While translations are generally reliable, understanding the original words adds depth and precision to our study."

**John MacArthur**: "Every student of Scripture should have some acquaintance with the original languages, not for showing off, but for more accurate understanding of God's Word."

### Hebrew (Old Testament) Basics

**Hebrew Characteristics**:
- **Right to left** reading direction
- **Consonantal alphabet** (vowels added later)
- **Root system** - Most words built on 3-letter roots
- **Concrete thinking** - Abstract concepts expressed through concrete imagery
- **Action-oriented** - Emphasis on what God does rather than philosophical concepts

**Key Hebrew Concepts**:
- **Hesed** (◊ó◊°◊ì) - Covenantal love, lovingkindness
- **Shalom** (◊©◊ú◊ï◊ù) - Peace, wholeness, completeness
- **Emunah** (◊ê◊û◊ï◊†◊î) - Faith, faithfulness, reliability
- **Ruach** (◊®◊ï◊ó) - Spirit, wind, breath
- **Kavod** (◊õ◊ë◊ï◊ì) - Glory, weight, importance

### Greek (New Testament) Basics

**Greek Characteristics**:
- **Precision in meaning** - Rich vocabulary for subtle distinctions
- **Complex grammar** - Verb tenses indicate aspect and time
- **Philosophical precision** - Abstract concepts clearly expressed
- **Case system** - Word endings show grammatical relationships

**Key Greek Concepts**:
- **Agape** (·ºÄŒ≥Œ¨œÄŒ∑) - Self-sacrificial love
- **Logos** (ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ) - Word, reason, divine revelation
- **Pistis** (œÄŒØœÉœÑŒπœÇ) - Faith, trust, confidence
- **Dunamis** (Œ¥œçŒΩŒ±ŒºŒπœÇ) - Power, ability, miracle
- **Aletheia** (·ºÄŒªŒÆŒ∏ŒµŒπŒ±) - Truth, reality, sincerity

## üîß ==Word Study Methodology==

### Step 1: ==Word Selection==
**Choose Significant Words**:
- Words repeated in the passage
- Theologically important terms
- Words that seem unclear in translation
- Key verbs showing action or state
- Words with multiple possible meanings

### Step 2: ==Identify Original Word==
**Tools for Word Identification**:
- **Strong's Concordance** - Links English words to original language
- **Interlinear Bible** - Shows original text with word-by-word translation
- **Bible software** (Logos, Accordance, Blue Letter Bible)

**Strong's Number System**:
- Hebrew words: H1-H8674
- Greek words: G1-G5624
- Example: "Love" in John 3:16 = G25 (agapao)

### Step 3: ==Lexical Analysis==
**Primary Meaning**:
- Basic dictionary definition
- Root meaning and etymology
- Range of possible translations

**Semantic Range**:
- How the word is used throughout Scripture
- Different contexts and meanings
- Theological development over time

### Step 4: ==Contextual Usage==
**Immediate Context**:
- How is the word used in this specific passage?
- What other words modify or relate to it?
- What is the grammatical structure?

**Biblical Usage**:
- How does this author typically use this word?
- How is it used elsewhere in Scripture?
- Are there patterns or developments?

### Step 5: ==Theological Synthesis==
**Doctrinal Implications**:
- What does this word teach about God?
- How does it relate to systematic theology?
- What are the practical applications?

## üöÄ ==Practical Word Study== Process

### ==Hebrew Word Study Example: "Hesed"==

**Step 1: Identification**
- Strong's H2617
- Often translated: mercy, kindness, lovingkindness
- Root: ◊ó◊°◊ì (bet-samech-dalet)

**Step 2: Lexical Analysis**
- **Primary meaning**: Steadfast love based on covenant relationship
- **Etymology**: Related to loyalty and faithfulness
- **Theological significance**: God's covenantal commitment to His people

**Step 3: Biblical Usage**
- **Psalms**: Most frequent usage (127 times)
- **With covenant**: Often paired with "covenant" (berith)
- **Divine attribute**: Describes God's character
- **Human response**: Expected loyalty between people

**Step 4: Contextual Examples**
- **Psalm 23:6**: "Surely goodness and hesed will follow me"
- **Exodus 34:6**: God's self-revelation includes hesed
- **Ruth 3:10**: Human example of hesed (Ruth to Naomi)

### ==Greek Word Study Example: "Agape"==

**Step 1: Identification**
- Strong's G26 (noun), G25 (verb)
- Often translated: love
- Distinguished from eros (romantic) and phileo (friendship)

**Step 2: Lexical Analysis**
- **Primary meaning**: Self-sacrificial, unconditional love
- **Christian usage**: Love that seeks highest good of others
- **Divine attribute**: God's essential nature (1 John 4:8)

**Step 3: Biblical Usage**
- **John's writings**: Theological development of concept
- **Paul's letters**: Practical applications
- **1 Corinthians 13**: Extended definition

**Step 4: Theological Synthesis**
- **God's nature**: "God is love" (agape)
- **Christ's sacrifice**: Ultimate demonstration
- **Christian command**: "Love one another as I have loved you"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ==Common Word Study== Errors

### ==Root Fallacy==
**Error**: Assuming a word always carries its root meaning
**Example**: Assuming "dynamite" comes from Greek "dunamis" (power)
**Solution**: Focus on usage in biblical context, not etymology

### ==Totality Transfer==
**Error**: Reading all possible meanings into one occurrence
**Example**: Loading every meaning of "kosmos" into John 3:16
**Solution**: Determine specific meaning from immediate context

### ==English Imposition==
**Error**: Assuming English and original language words are equivalent
**Example**: Thinking Greek "sarx" (flesh) means only physical body
**Solution**: Study original language categories, not English equivalents

### ==Overemphasis on Uniqueness==
**Error**: Finding theological significance in common words
**Example**: Making "carpenter" (tekton) theologically significant for Jesus
**Solution**: Distinguish between significant and routine word choices
