## üîß Theological Foundation of Expository Preaching

### Biblical Mandate for Expository Preaching
```yaml
Scripture's Authority and Sufficiency:
  2 Timothy 3:16-17:
    - All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable
    - Adequate for teaching, reproof, correction, training
    - Makes man of God complete and equipped
    - Foundation for preaching ministry

  2 Timothy 4:2:
    - "Preach the Word" - primary command
    - Be ready in season and out of season
    - Reprove, rebuke, exhort with patience and teaching
    - Urgency and faithfulness required

Historical Precedent:
  Ezra's Example (Nehemiah 8:1-8):
    - Read from the Law clearly
    - Gave the sense and helped understanding
    - People understood the reading
    - Model of expository preaching

  Jesus' Ministry:
    - Luke 4:16-21 - Exposition of Isaiah 61
    - Systematic teaching through Scripture
    - Authority from Scripture, not tradition
    - Example for all subsequent preaching
```

### Nature and Definition
```yaml
Definition of Expository Preaching:
  Core Elements:
    - The text provides the substance of the sermon
    - The structure flows from the text
    - The main idea comes from the text
    - Application flows from textual meaning

  Distinguishing Characteristics:
    - Text-driven rather than topic-driven
    - Author's intended meaning preserved
    - Contemporary application based on original meaning
    - Sequential treatment of biblical books

Contrast with Other Methods:
  Topical Preaching:
    - Starts with topic, finds supporting texts
    - Risk of imposing meaning on Scripture
    - May ignore context and authorial intent
    - Limited exposure to full range of Scripture

  Textual Preaching:
    - Uses text as starting point
    - May depart from text's main theme
    - Risk of allegory or spiritualizing
    - Inconsistent with systematic exposition
```
