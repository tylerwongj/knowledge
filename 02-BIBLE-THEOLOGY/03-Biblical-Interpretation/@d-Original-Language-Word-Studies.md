## 🔧 Hebrew Word Study Methodology

### Hebrew Language Fundamentals
**Key Characteristics**:
- **Consonantal Script**: Original Hebrew written without vowels
- **Tri-Consonantal Roots**: Most words built on three-letter root system
- **Semantic Fields**: Words clustered around conceptual meanings
- **Verbal System**: Focus on aspect (completed/incomplete) rather than time

**Essential Hebrew Concepts**:
```
Root System Examples:

- ח-ס-ד (chesed): Lovingkindness, covenant loyalty, mercy
- צ-ד-ק (tsadaq): Righteousness, justice, vindication
- ב-ר-כ (barak): Bless, blessing, kneel
```

### Hebrew Word Study Process
**Step-by-Step Methodology**:
```
1. Identify Hebrew word and root system
2. Research word frequency and distribution across OT
3. Analyze semantic range and contextual usage patterns  
4. Study syntactical relationships within verse/passage
5. Compare usage across different biblical authors/periods
6. Integrate findings with theological context
```
