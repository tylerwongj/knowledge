## üîç Advanced Integration Techniques

### Analogy of Faith Application

**Principle Definition**: Scripture interprets Scripture - clearer passages illuminate unclear ones; Scripture maintains internal consistency and coherence.

**Application Methodology**:
```markdown
**Clear Text Priority**: Let explicit teachings interpret implicit ones
**Canonical Consistency**: Maintain theological coherence across Scripture
**Central vs. Peripheral**: Distinguish essential from secondary matters
**Progressive Clarity**: Later revelation clarifies earlier teachings
**Christological Focus**: Christ as ultimate interpretive key
```

**Practical Implementation**:
1. Identify clearest Biblical passages on topic
2. Use explicit texts to interpret implicit or difficult passages
3. Maintain theological consistency across Biblical corpus
4. Apply Christ-centered hermeneutical approach
5. Consider confessional theological tradition
