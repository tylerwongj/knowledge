- Build comprehensive framework for doctrinal study and spiritual growth

## üìñ Reformed Hermeneutical Foundations

### Scripture as the Supreme Authority
```markdown
**Sola Scriptura Principles**:
- Scripture interprets Scripture (analogia Scripturae)
- Clear passages illuminate difficult passages
- Biblical context determines meaning, not human tradition
- Original authorial intent guides interpretation
- Grammar and historical context are foundational

**Westminster Confession of Faith 1.9**:
"The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture itself; 
and therefore, when there is a question about the true and full sense of any 
scripture (which is not manifold, but one), it must be searched and known by 
other places that speak more clearly."
```

### Grammatical-Historical Method
```markdown
**Exegetical Process Framework**:
1. **Textual Analysis**: Establish accurate original text
2. **Grammatical Analysis**: Parse syntax, word meanings, grammatical structures
3. **Historical Analysis**: Understand cultural, historical, and literary context
4. **Literary Analysis**: Identify genre, structure, and rhetorical devices
5. **Theological Analysis**: Integrate findings with broader biblical theology
6. **Practical Application**: Apply timeless truths to contemporary Christian living

**Key Interpretive Principles**:
- Single meaning principle: Each text has one intended meaning
- Progressive revelation: Later revelation builds upon and clarifies earlier revelation
- Covenant structure: Understanding God's covenantal dealings throughout history
- Typological interpretation: Recognizing legitimate types and antitypes in Scripture
```
