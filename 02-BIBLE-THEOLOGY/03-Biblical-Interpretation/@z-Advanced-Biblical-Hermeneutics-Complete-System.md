## ðŸ”§ Foundational Hermeneutical Framework

### Core Principles of Biblical Hermeneutics

#### Scripture Interprets Scripture (Analogia Scripturae)
```
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE:
Scripture is its own best interpreter - clearer passages illuminate obscure ones

PRACTICAL APPLICATION:
1. Cross-Reference Analysis
   - Use concordances and topical Bibles
   - Compare parallel passages
   - Track theological themes across Scripture
   - Identify progressive revelation patterns

2. Biblical-Theological Method
   - Trace themes from Genesis to Revelation
   - Understand covenantal development
   - See Christ as the center of Scripture
   - Apply typological interpretation carefully

3. Systematic Integration
   - Harmonize apparent contradictions
   - Build doctrine from multiple passages
   - Distinguish between descriptive and prescriptive texts
   - Maintain theological consistency

BIBLICAL FOUNDATION:
- Luke 24:27: "And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself"
- 1 Corinthians 2:13: "This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual realities with Spirit-taught words"
- 2 Peter 1:20-21: "Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet's own interpretation"

HERMENEUTICAL SAFEGUARDS:
- Clear passages interpret unclear ones
- Explicit statements take priority over implications
- Historical context must inform theological application
- Original authorial intent guides interpretation
```
