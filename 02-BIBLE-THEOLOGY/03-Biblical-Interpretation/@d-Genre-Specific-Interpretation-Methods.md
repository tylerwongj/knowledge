## üîß Comprehensive Genre Classification & Methods

### 1. Narrative Literature Interpretation

**Hebrew Narrative Characteristics**:
- Selective historical reporting with theological purpose
- Character development through action and dialogue
- Plot structure with conflict, climax, and resolution
- Theological themes communicated through story elements

**Interpretive Methodology**:
```markdown
**Step 1**: Identify narrative structure and plot development
**Step 2**: Analyze character development and motivations  
**Step 3**: Recognize theological themes and moral points
**Step 4**: Distinguish descriptive vs. prescriptive elements
**Step 5**: Apply typological interpretation appropriately
**Step 6**: Connect to broader redemptive-historical narrative
```

**Key Interpretive Principles**:
- **Descriptive vs. Prescriptive**: Not every action described is endorsed
- **Character Focus**: Often highlights human failure and divine grace
- **Theological Purpose**: History written with theological intent
- **Typological Awareness**: Old Testament events foreshadow New Testament realities

**Common Interpretation Errors**:
- Moralizing stories without considering theological purpose
- Assuming all described actions are prescribed
- Missing larger theological themes for minor details
- Applying cultural specifics without hermeneutical filter

### 2. Poetry and Wisdom Literature

**Hebrew Poetry Characteristics**:
- **Parallelism**: Thought patterns rather than rhyme schemes
- **Figurative Language**: Extensive use of metaphor and imagery
- **Emotional Expression**: Wide range of human experience
- **Theological Reflection**: Divine truth through poetic medium

**Parallelism Types and Interpretation**:
```markdown
**Synonymous Parallelism**: Second line reinforces first
- Interpretation: Look for emphasis and intensification
- Example: Psalm 119:105 - "lamp" and "light" reinforce guidance theme

**Antithetic Parallelism**: Second line contrasts with first  
- Interpretation: Understand contrast for theological emphasis
- Example: Proverbs 10:1 - Wise vs. foolish son contrast

**Synthetic Parallelism**: Second line develops or completes first
- Interpretation: See progressive development of thought
- Example: Psalm 1:3 - Tree metaphor developed progressively
```

**Wisdom Literature Principles**:
- **General Truth vs. Absolute Promise**: Proverbs state general principles
- **Fear of the Lord**: Central organizing principle for wisdom
- **Practical Theology**: Theological truth applied to daily life
- **Experiential Knowledge**: Wisdom gained through observation and experience

### 3. Prophetic Literature Interpretation

**Prophetic Characteristics**:
- **Covenant Enforcement**: Calling people back to covenant faithfulness
- **Dual Timeline**: Near and far fulfillment patterns
- **Symbolic Language**: Extensive use of imagery and metaphor
- **Conditional Elements**: Many prophecies contain implicit conditions

**Interpretive Framework**:
```markdown
**Historical Context**: Understand original audience and circumstances
**Literary Analysis**: Recognize poetic and symbolic elements
**Theological Purpose**: Identify covenant themes and divine character
**Fulfillment Patterns**: Distinguish between near and far fulfillment
**Christological Focus**: Understand ultimate fulfillment in Christ
**Eschatological Application**: Apply to present and future appropriately
```

**Prophecy Fulfillment Categories**:
- **Historical Fulfillment**: Completed in Old Testament period
- **Christological Fulfillment**: Fulfilled in Christ's first coming
- **Eschatological Fulfillment**: Awaiting Christ's second coming
- **Typological Fulfillment**: Pattern repeated throughout history

### 4. Legal Literature (Torah/Law)

**Law Categories and Application**:
```markdown
**Moral Law**: Reflects God's character (Ten Commandments)
- Application: Universal and timeless principles
- Hermeneutic: Direct application with cultural translation

**Civil Law**: Governed Israel as theocratic nation
- Application: Underlying principles, not specific legislation
- Hermeneutic: Extract theological and ethical principles

**Ceremonial Law**: Ritual and worship regulations
- Application: Fulfilled in Christ, ceremonial aspects obsolete
- Hermeneutic: Understand typological significance and fulfillment
```

**Legal Interpretation Principles**:
- **Case Law vs. Apodictic Law**: Different application methods
- **Cultural Context**: Understand ancient Near Eastern legal background
- **Covenant Structure**: Law within covenant relationship framework
- **Christ's Fulfillment**: All law finds fulfillment in Christ

### 5. Epistolary Literature

**Letter Characteristics**:
- **Occasional Nature**: Written to address specific situations
- **Apostolic Authority**: Authoritative teaching for the church
- **Theological Instruction**: Systematic doctrine and practical application
- **Cultural Context**: First-century Greco-Roman context

**Interpretation Methodology**:
```markdown
**Step 1**: Identify specific occasion and audience
**Step 2**: Understand cultural and historical background
**Step 3**: Distinguish universal principles from specific applications
**Step 4**: Apply systematic theological framework
**Step 5**: Consider canonical context and parallel passages
**Step 6**: Develop contemporary applications appropriately
```

**Application Principles**:
- **Universal vs. Particular**: Distinguish timeless truth from specific application
- **Cultural Translation**: Apply principles across cultural boundaries
- **Theological Consistency**: Maintain doctrinal coherence
- **Pastoral Sensitivity**: Consider practical implications

### 6. Apocalyptic Literature

**Apocalyptic Characteristics**:

**Preterist**: Fulfilled in first century (partial application)
**Historicist**: Fulfillment throughout church history (limited application)
**Futurist**: Primary fulfillment in end times (dominant approach)
**Idealist**: Symbolic of ongoing spiritual realities (supplementary)
```

**Interpretation Guidelines**:
- **Symbolic Recognition**: Understand metaphorical vs. literal elements
- **Old Testament Background**: Heavy use of Old Testament imagery
- **Progressive Revelation**: Build on previous Biblical revelation
- **Christological Focus**: Christ as central figure and key to interpretation
