## üîß Foundations of Biblical Typology

### Definition and Theological Basis
**Typology Defined**: Divinely intended correspondences between Old Testament persons, events, and institutions (types) and their New Testament fulfillment (antitypes) in Christ and His work.

**Key Characteristics of Valid Types**:
- **Historical Reality**: Types must be historically real, not merely symbolic
- **Divine Intent**: God designed the correspondence, not merely human interpretation
- **Escalation**: Antitype exceeds type in significance and scope
- **New Testament Authorization**: Antitype identification confirmed by Scripture

**Distinction from Allegory**:
- **Typology**: Based on historical correspondences intended by God
- **Allegory**: Symbolic interpretation without necessary historical basis
- **Hermeneutical Control**: Scripture interprets Scripture principle

### Biblical Foundation for Typology

**New Testament Examples**:
```markdown
**Adam-Christ Typology** (Romans 5:12-21):
Type: Adam as representative head bringing death and condemnation
Antitype: Christ as representative head bringing life and justification
Escalation: Greater than Adam's failure is Christ's obedience

**Moses-Christ Typology** (Hebrews 3:1-6):
Type: Moses as faithful servant in God's house
Antitype: Christ as faithful Son over God's house  
Escalation: Son's authority exceeds servant's position

**David-Christ Typology** (Multiple passages):
Type: David as anointed king after God's heart
Antitype: Christ as eternal King and Messiah
Escalation: Eternal kingdom exceeds temporal kingdom
```

**Old Testament Anticipatory Elements**:
- **Sacrificial System**: Pointing to ultimate sacrifice in Christ
- **Priesthood**: Foreshadowing Christ's high priestly work
- **Kingship**: Anticipating Messianic rule and authority
- **Prophetic Office**: Prefiguring Christ as ultimate Prophet
