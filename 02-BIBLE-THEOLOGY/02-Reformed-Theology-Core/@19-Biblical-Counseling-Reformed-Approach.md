### Foundational Theological Principles
```markdown
# Reformed Biblical Counseling Foundations

## Scripture Sufficiency (2 Timothy 3:16-17)
- **Total Sufficiency**: Scripture provides all necessary truth for life and godliness
- **Progressive Sanctification**: Change occurs through Word-centered transformation
- **Spirit's Ministry**: The Holy Spirit applies Scripture to hearts for genuine change
- **Christ's Centrality**: All counseling ultimately points to Christ's person and work

## Anthropological Framework
- **Imago Dei**: Humans created in God's image with inherent dignity and worth
- **Total Depravity**: Sin affects every aspect of human nature (mind, will, emotions)
- **Union with Christ**: Believers possess new identity and spiritual resources in Christ
- **Heart Orientation**: Biblical change occurs at the heart level, not merely behavioral

## Sanctification Process
- **Definitive Sanctification**: Positional holiness through justification
- **Progressive Sanctification**: Ongoing transformation by grace through faith
- **Mortification and Vivification**: Putting off sin and putting on righteousness
- **Means of Grace**: Word, prayer, sacraments, fellowship as transformation tools
```

### Biblical Counseling Methodology
```markdown
# CCEF Model Integration with Reformed Theology

## Four Essential Questions Framework
1. **What is going on?** (Situation assessment through biblical lens)
   - Examine circumstances, relationships, and heart responses
   - Identify sinful patterns, idolatries, and false beliefs
   - Assess physical, relational, and spiritual factors

2. **What is God doing?** (Divine perspective and sovereignty)
   - God's purposes in suffering and trials (Romans 8:28-29)
   - Sanctification opportunities within current struggles
   - Gospel truth applicable to present circumstances

3. **What are you doing?** (Personal responsibility and heart examination)
   - Heart motivations and desires driving behavior
   - Sinful responses requiring repentance
   - Areas of growth and obedience needed

4. **What do you need to do?** (Biblical change process)
   - Specific repentance and faith responses
   - Practical steps of obedience and growth
   - Accountability and ongoing discipleship needs

## Reformed Distinctive Elements
- **Covenant Context**: Understanding struggles within God's covenant relationship
- **Election and Perseverance**: Assurance based on God's eternal purpose
- **Means of Grace**: Emphasis on Word, prayer, and church community
- **Westminster Standards**: Utilizing catechisms and confessions for doctrinal clarity
```

### Practical Counseling Applications
```markdown
# Common Counseling Issues - Reformed Approach

## Anxiety and Worry (Matthew 6:25-34, Philippians 4:6-7)
### Biblical Analysis
- **Root Issue**: Functional atheism - living as if God is not sovereign
- **Heart Idolatries**: Security, control, approval, comfort
- **Gospel Truth**: God's perfect love casts out fear (1 John 4:18)

### Reformed Counseling Strategy
1. **Examine Fear**: What specific fears reveal about heart treasures?
2. **Gospel Reminder**: God's sovereignty and fatherly care in Christ
3. **Practical Obedience**: Prayer, thanksgiving, and trust exercises
4. **Community Support**: Church body involvement in anxiety struggles

## Depression and Despair (Psalm 42-43, 2 Corinthians 1:8-11)
### Biblical Analysis
- **Multifaceted Issue**: Physical, spiritual, circumstantial factors
- **Heart Examination**: Hopelessness, self-focus, lack of gospel joy
- **Scripture's Realism**: Honest acknowledgment of suffering and sorrow

### Reformed Counseling Approach
1. **Validate Suffering**: Acknowledge real pain without minimizing
2. **Gospel Hope**: Union with Christ provides unshakeable identity
3. **Spiritual Disciplines**: Word meditation, prayer, fellowship
4. **Medical Consideration**: Appropriate medical evaluation when needed

## Marriage and Family Conflicts (Ephesians 5:22-33, Colossians 3:18-21)
### Biblical Framework
- **Creation Design**: Marriage reflects Christ and church relationship
- **Sin's Impact**: Selfishness, pride, and control damage relationships
- **Covenant Understanding**: Marriage as sacred covenant, not mere contract

### Reformed Counseling Method
1. **Gospel Foundation**: Each spouse's identity in Christ first
2. **Role Clarification**: Biblical headship and submission properly understood
3. **Mutual Service**: Christ-like love and respect patterns
4. **Church Accountability**: Community involvement in restoration process

## Addiction and Compulsive Behaviors (Romans 6:1-14, Galatians 5:16-24)
### Biblical Analysis
- **Worship Disorder**: Addiction as false worship and idolatry
- **Heart Bondage**: Enslaved to created things rather than Creator
- **Gospel Freedom**: Christ's death breaks sin's power and guilt

### Reformed Treatment Approach
1. **Heart Exposure**: Identify functional gods being served
2. **Repentance Process**: Genuine sorrow leading to change
3. **Identity Renewal**: Walking in new creation reality
4. **Accountability Structure**: Church discipline and restoration
```

### Discipleship Integration Model
```markdown
# Biblical Counseling as Intensive Discipleship

- **Burden Bearing and Support** (Galatians 6:2, 1 Thessalonians 5:14)

## Pastoral Care Integration

- **Doctrinal Soundness**: Ensuring theological accuracy in counsel
