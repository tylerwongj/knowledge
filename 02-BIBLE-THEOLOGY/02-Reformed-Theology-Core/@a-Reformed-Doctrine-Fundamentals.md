## ðŸ”§ Core Reformed Theological Framework

### The Five Solas - Foundation of Reformed Faith

#### 1. Sola Scriptura (Scripture Alone)
**Biblical Foundation:**
- 2 Timothy 3:16-17 - "All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness"
- Isaiah 8:20 - "To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, they have no light of dawn"

**Key Principles:**
- Scripture is the supreme and final authority for faith and practice
- Scripture interprets Scripture (analogia scripturae)
- The clarity of Scripture allows believers to understand essential truths
- Church tradition and reason are subordinate to Scripture

**Practical Application:**
```
Daily Bible Reading Framework:
1. Observe - What does the text say?
2. Interpret - What does the text mean?
3. Apply - How does this truth change my life?
4. Prayer - Ask God to work this truth into your heart
```

#### 2. Sola Gratia (Grace Alone)
**Biblical Foundation:**
- Ephesians 2:8-9 - "For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works"
- Romans 11:6 - "But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace"

**Key Principles:**
- Salvation is entirely by God's unmerited favor
- Human beings contribute nothing to their salvation
- Grace is the sole efficient cause of regeneration and conversion
- Good works are the result, not the cause, of salvation

#### 3. Sola Fide (Faith Alone)
**Biblical Foundation:**
- Romans 3:28 - "For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law"
- Galatians 2:16 - "We know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ"

**Key Principles:**
- Justification is by faith alone, not faith plus works
- Faith is the sole instrumental cause of justification
- Faith itself is a gift from God, not a human work
- True faith always produces good works as evidence

#### 4. Solus Christus (Christ Alone)
**Biblical Foundation:**
- Acts 4:12 - "And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved"
- 1 Timothy 2:5 - "For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus"

**Key Principles:**
- Christ is the only mediator between God and humanity
- Salvation is found exclusively in Jesus Christ
- Christ's person and work are sufficient for salvation
- No saint, priest, or institution can mediate salvation

#### 5. Soli Deo Gloria (Glory to God Alone)
**Biblical Foundation:**
- 1 Corinthians 10:31 - "So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God"
- Isaiah 43:7 - "Everyone who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory"

**Key Principles:**
- All of life exists for God's glory
- Salvation displays God's glory, not human achievement
- Every aspect of Christian living should honor God
- The ultimate purpose of all things is God's glory

## ðŸš€ TULIP: The Doctrines of Grace

### Total Depravity
**Biblical Foundation:**
- Romans 3:10-12 - "None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God"
- Ephesians 2:1 - "And you were dead in the trespasses and sins"
- Jeremiah 17:9 - "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick"

**Key Principles:**
- Sin affects every aspect of human nature (mind, will, emotions, body)
- Humans are spiritually dead and unable to respond to God
- The image of God is marred but not destroyed
- Total depravity doesn't mean humans are as evil as they could be

**Practical Implications:**
- Humility in recognizing our complete dependence on God
- Understanding the necessity of divine grace for salvation
- Patience with the ongoing struggle against sin
- Realistic expectations about human nature and society

### Unconditional Election
**Biblical Foundation:**
- Ephesians 1:4-5 - "He chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him"
- Romans 9:11 - "Though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or badâ€”in order that God's purpose of election might continue"

**Key Principles:**
- God's choice of the elect is not based on foreseen faith or works
- Election is according to God's sovereign will and pleasure
- Election is from eternity past and is unchangeable
- Election ensures the salvation of those chosen

**Pastoral Comfort:**
- Assurance of salvation rests on God's eternal choice
- Perseverance is guaranteed by God's unchanging purpose
- Evangelism is encouraged knowing God has chosen people to save
- God's love for his people is unshakeable

### Limited Atonement (Particular Redemption)
**Biblical Foundation:**
- Matthew 1:21 - "She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins"
- John 10:11 - "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep"
- Ephesians 5:25 - "Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her"

**Key Principles:**
- Christ died specifically for the elect
- The atonement actually saves, not just makes salvation possible
- The value of Christ's sacrifice is infinite
- The design of the atonement is particular

**Biblical Clarity:**
- Christ's death accomplishes salvation for his people
- The effectiveness of the atonement guarantees salvation
- God's justice is satisfied for all whom Christ represented
- The scope is limited but the power is unlimited

### Irresistible Grace (Effectual Calling)
**Biblical Foundation:**
- John 6:37 - "All that the Father gives me will come to me"
- Romans 8:30 - "And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified"
- 1 Peter 1:3 - "He has caused us to be born again to a living hope"

**Key Principles:**
- God's grace effectively accomplishes its purpose
- The elect will certainly respond to the gospel call
- Regeneration precedes faith
- The Holy Spirit overcomes resistance to the gospel

**Encouragement for Ministry:**
- Confidence in evangelism knowing God will save his people
- Prayer for the lost with assurance God can change hearts
- Patience in ministry knowing conversion is God's work
- Perseverance in difficult mission fields

### Perseverance of the Saints (Eternal Security)
**Biblical Foundation:**
- John 10:28-29 - "I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand"
- Romans 8:38-39 - "I am sure that neither death nor life...will be able to separate us from the love of God"
- Philippians 1:6 - "He who began a good work in you will bring it to completion"

**Key Principles:**
- True believers will persevere to the end
- God preserves his people through all trials
- Apostasy proves one was never truly converted
- Assurance is possible and desirable

**Practical Living:**
- Confidence in facing trials and persecution
- Motivation for holy living out of gratitude
- Comfort in times of doubt and struggle
- Encouragement to press on in sanctification

## ðŸ”§ Reformed Hermeneutics (Biblical Interpretation)

### Grammatical-Historical Method

1. **Literal Interpretation** - Take the plain meaning unless context demands otherwise
2. **Historical Context** - Understand the original setting and circumstances
3. **Literary Context** - Consider the immediate and broader textual context
4. **Analogia Scripturae** - Scripture interprets Scripture
5. **Christocentric Reading** - All Scripture points to Christ (Luke 24:27)

### Covenant Theology Framework
**Major Covenants:**
1. **Covenant of Works** - Adam's original relationship with God
2. **Covenant of Grace** - God's redemptive plan through Christ
3. **Covenant of Redemption** - The eternal plan between Father, Son, and Spirit

**Unity of Scripture:**
- One people of God throughout history
- Progressive revelation building to Christ
