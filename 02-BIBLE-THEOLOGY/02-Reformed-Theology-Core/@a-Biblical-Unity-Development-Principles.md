## ðŸš€ AI/LLM Integration with Biblical Wisdom

### AI Ethics and Biblical Principles

**Christian AI Ethics Prompt:**
> "How can AI development tools be used ethically in game development from a Christian perspective? Consider biblical principles of stewardship, honesty, love for neighbor, and wise use of technology. Provide practical guidelines for Unity developers."

### Scripture-Guided Development Decisions

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Decision-making framework based on biblical wisdom
/// "If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God" - James 1:5
/// </summary>
public class BiblicalDecisionFramework : MonoBehaviour

        // 3. Is this wise according to Scripture? (Proverbs)
        // 4. Am I being a good steward of resources? (Matthew 25:14-30)
        // 5. Does this maintain integrity and honesty? (Proverbs 12:22)
        // 6. Will this build up rather than tear down? (Ephesians 4:29)

        return positiveAnswers >= 5; // Strong biblical alignment
    }
    
    public void PrayForWisdomInDevelopment()

        Debug.Log("Seeking God's wisdom for development decisions and creative direction");
        
        // Practical application:
        // - Begin development sessions with prayer
        // - Seek counsel from mature Christian mentors
        // - Study Scripture relevant to current challenges
        // - Maintain accountability in decision-making
