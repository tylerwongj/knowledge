## ðŸ”§ Core Reformed Theological Framework

### Foundational Principles of Reformed Theology

#### The Five Solas (Principles of the Reformation)
```
SOLA SCRIPTURA (Scripture Alone)
- Scripture as the ultimate authority for faith and practice
- Scripture interprets Scripture (analogia scripturae)
- The clarity and sufficiency of Scripture for salvation and Christian living
- Scripture's authority over tradition, reason, and experience

Biblical Foundation:
- 2 Timothy 3:16-17: "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness"
- Isaiah 8:20: "To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, they have no light of dawn"
- Psalm 19:7-11: The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul

SOLA GRATIA (Grace Alone)
- Salvation entirely by God's unmerited favor
- Human inability to contribute to salvation
- Grace as God's sovereign choice, not human decision or merit
- Irresistible grace that effectively calls the elect

Biblical Foundation:
- Ephesians 2:8-9: "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faithâ€”and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God"
- Romans 9:16: "It does not, therefore, depend on human desire or effort, but on God's mercy"
- John 6:44: "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them"

SOLA FIDE (Faith Alone)
- Justification by faith alone, apart from works
- Faith as the instrument, not the ground of justification
- Imputation of Christ's righteousness to believers
- Faith itself as a gift from God

Biblical Foundation:
- Romans 3:28: "For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law"
- Philippians 3:9: "Not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ"
- Galatians 2:16: "Know that a person is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ"

SOLUS CHRISTUS (Christ Alone)
- Christ as the only mediator between God and humanity
- Salvation exclusively through Christ's person and work
- Christ's dual nature: fully God and fully man
- Christ's threefold office: Prophet, Priest, and King

Biblical Foundation:
- 1 Timothy 2:5: "For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus"
- Acts 4:12: "Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved"
- John 14:6: "Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me'"

SOLI DEO GLORIA (Glory to God Alone)
- All of life lived for God's glory
- Salvation designed to display God's glory
- Human purpose: to glorify God and enjoy Him forever
- Rejection of human-centered theology and practice

Biblical Foundation:
- 1 Corinthians 10:31: "So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God"
- Ephesians 1:6: "To the praise of his glorious grace, which he has freely given us in the One he loves"
- Isaiah 43:7: "Everyone who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made"
```

### TULIP: The Five Points of Calvinism

#### Total Depravity
```
DEFINITION: Human beings are completely affected by sin in all aspects of their being

KEY CONCEPTS:
- Sin affects mind, will, emotions, and body
- Inability to seek God or choose salvation apart from grace
- Natural hostility toward God and His law
- Bondage of the will to sin

Biblical Foundation:
- Romans 3:10-12: "None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God"
- Ephesians 2:1: "And you were dead in the trespasses and sins"
- 1 Corinthians 2:14: "The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God"
- John 8:34: "Everyone who sins is a slave to sin"

IMPLICATIONS:
- Evangelism depends on God's sovereign grace
- Human cooperation in salvation is impossible
- Need for regeneration before faith
- Humility in Christian living and ministry

PASTORAL APPLICATIONS:
- Preaching must include human sinfulness and need for grace
- Counseling acknowledges the reality of indwelling sin
- Church discipline rooted in understanding of sin's seriousness
- Evangelism with confidence in God's power to save
```

#### Unconditional Election
```
DEFINITION: God's eternal choice of individuals for salvation based solely on His sovereign will

KEY CONCEPTS:

- 2 Timothy 1:9: "He has saved us and called us to a holy lifeâ€”not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace"

COMMON OBJECTIONS AND RESPONSES:
Objection: "This makes God unfair"
Response: God's justice requires punishment for sin; mercy is undeserved favor

Objection: "This eliminates human responsibility"
Response: Scripture affirms both divine sovereignty and human responsibility

Objection: "This discourages evangelism"
Response: Election is the foundation that makes evangelism effective

PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS:
- Assurance of salvation rooted in God's unchanging choice
- Humility regarding our salvation
