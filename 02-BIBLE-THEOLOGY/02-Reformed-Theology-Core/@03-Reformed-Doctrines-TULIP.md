## üå∑ TULIP: The Five Points of Calvinism

### T - Total Depravity
**Definition**: Humanity is completely unable to seek God or contribute to salvation due to the effects of sin.

#### Biblical Foundation
**Primary Texts**:
- **Romans 3:10-12**: "None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God."
- **Ephesians 2:1**: "You were dead in the trespasses and sins"
- **1 Corinthians 2:14**: "The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God"
- **John 6:44**: "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him"

#### Reformed Theological Explanation

**R.C. Sproul**: "Total depravity means that sin affects all parts of our being. It doesn't mean we're as bad as we possibly could be, but that we're bad in every part of our being."

**John MacArthur**: "The unregenerate person is spiritually dead, not spiritually sick. Dead people don't cooperate in their resurrection."

**Key Implications**:
- Human will is enslaved to sin (Romans 6:17-20)
- Natural man cannot understand spiritual truth (1 Corinthians 2:14)
- All human faculties affected: mind, will, emotions, conscience
- Regeneration must precede faith (John 3:3-8)

#### Practical Applications
- **Evangelism**: Recognize only God can convert hearts
- **Sanctification**: Continue dependence on God's grace for growth
- **Humility**: Acknowledge complete dependence on divine mercy
- **Prayer**: Intercede for God to open blind eyes and deaf ears

### U - Unconditional Election
**Definition**: God's choice of individuals for salvation based solely on His sovereign will, not foreseen faith or works.

#### Biblical Foundation
**Primary Texts**:
- **Ephesians 1:4-5**: "He chose us in him before the foundation of the world... having predestined us for adoption"
- **Romans 9:11**: "Though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad... she was told, 'The older will serve the younger'"
- **2 Timothy 1:9**: "Who saved us... not because of our works but because of his own purpose and grace"
- **Acts 13:48**: "And as many as were appointed to eternal life believed"

#### Reformed Theological Explanation

**John Piper**: "Election is unconditional because it is not based on anything God foresees in us that would make us worthy of his choice."

**John MacArthur**: "God's election is not based on His foreknowledge of our faith, but His foreknowledge is based on His election."

**Key Implications**:
- Election occurred before creation (Ephesians 1:4)
- Based on God's good pleasure, not human merit (Romans 9:11)
- Ensures salvation of God's people (Romans 8:29-30)
- Source of assurance and comfort for believers

#### Practical Applications
- **Assurance**: Salvation depends on God's unchanging choice
- **Evangelism**: Preach confidently knowing God has His elect
- **Perseverance**: God's choice guarantees final salvation
- **Worship**: Marvel at undeserved grace and sovereign love

### L - Limited Atonement (Definite Atonement)
**Definition**: Christ's death was intended specifically for the elect and actually secures their salvation.

#### Biblical Foundation
**Primary Texts**:
- **Matthew 1:21**: "He will save his people from their sins"
- **John 10:11**: "The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep"
- **John 17:9**: "I am praying for them. I am not praying for the world but for those whom you have given me"
- **Ephesians 5:25**: "Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her"

#### Reformed Theological Explanation

**John Owen**: "The Father imposed His wrath due unto, and the Son underwent the punishment for, either: 1) All the sins of all men, 2) All the sins of some men, or 3) Some of the sins of all men. If the last, some sins of all men, then all men have some sins to answer for... If the second, then Christ, in their stead, suffered for all the sins of all the elect in the whole world... If the first, why are not all men free from the punishment of all their sins?"

**R.C. Sproul**: "If Christ paid for the sins of those who perish, then God would be guilty of double jeopardy by punishing the same sins twice."

**Key Implications**:
- Christ's death actually saves, not merely makes salvation possible
- Atonement secures all necessary grace for salvation
- Perfect satisfaction of God's justice for the elect
- Guarantees application of redemption by the Spirit

#### Practical Applications
- **Assurance**: Christ's death fully paid for all your sins
- **Worship**: Celebrate the personal nature of Christ's sacrifice
- **Evangelism**: Proclaim Christ's sufficient sacrifice for all who believe
- **Pastoral Care**: Comfort believers with definite redemption

### I - Irresistible Grace (Effectual Calling)
**Definition**: God's call to salvation cannot be ultimately resisted by those He has chosen.

#### Biblical Foundation
**Primary Texts**:
- **John 6:37**: "All that the Father gives me will come to me"
- **John 6:44**: "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him"
- **Romans 8:30**: "Those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified"
- **1 Corinthians 1:23-24**: "But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God"

#### Reformed Theological Explanation

**John Piper**: "Irresistible grace does not mean that God forces people against their will, but that God changes the will."

**Martyn Lloyd-Jones**: "This divine call is not merely an external call through the preaching of the Word, but an internal call of the Holy Spirit which regenerates."

**Key Implications**:
- Internal call differs from external gospel invitation
- Regeneration precedes and enables faith
- God removes heart of stone, gives heart of flesh (Ezekiel 36:26)
- All who are effectually called will respond in faith

#### Practical Applications
- **Evangelism**: Trust God to work in hearts through Word preaching
- **Prayer**: Ask God to make His call effectual in unbelievers
- **Patience**: Allow God's timing in drawing people to salvation
- **Confidence**: God's call will accomplish His purpose

### P - Perseverance of the Saints (Eternal Security)
**Definition**: Those truly saved will persevere in faith and never finally fall away.

#### Biblical Foundation
**Primary Texts**:
- **John 10:28-29**: "I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand"
- **Romans 8:38-39**: "Neither death nor life... will be able to separate us from the love of God"
- **Philippians 1:6**: "He who began a good work in you will bring it to completion"
- **1 Peter 1:5**: "Who by God's power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed"

#### Reformed Theological Explanation

**John MacArthur**: "Perseverance is not the believer holding on to God, but God holding on to the believer."

**R.C. Sproul**: "If we can lose our salvation, then we have to conclude that there is something we can do that is more powerful than the cross of Christ."

**Key Implications**:
- Preservation based on God's power, not human effort
- True believers will demonstrate perseverance through good works
- Apostasy reveals false profession, not loss of salvation
- Assurance grounded in God's faithful character

#### Practical Applications
- **Assurance**: Rest in God's keeping power, not personal performance  
- **Sanctification**: Good works flow from gratitude, not fear of loss
- **Church Discipline**: Some departures reveal false profession
- **Pastoral Care**: Encourage struggling believers with God's faithfulness

## üèõÔ∏è Historical Development
