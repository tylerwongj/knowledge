### The Jerusalem Church
The earliest Christian community began in Jerusalem following Christ's resurrection and ascension. This foundational period established patterns that would influence the church for centuries.

A pivotal moment in early church history when leaders addressed the inclusion of Gentiles:
- **Issue**: Whether Gentile converts needed to be circumcised and follow Jewish law
- **Resolution**: Freedom from ceremonial law while maintaining moral standards
- **Significance**: Established precedent for doctrinal decision-making through council deliberation
- **Impact**: Enabled rapid expansion of Christianity beyond Jewish communities

### Pauline Church Planting
The Apostle Paul's missionary journeys transformed Christianity from a Jewish sect into a universal religion.

#### Missionary Strategy
