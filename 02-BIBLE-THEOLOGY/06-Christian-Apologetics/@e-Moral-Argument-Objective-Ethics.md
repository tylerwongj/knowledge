# @e-Moral Argument Objective Ethics - God as Foundation of Moral Truth

## üéØ Learning Objectives
- Master the moral argument for God's existence and its logical structure
- Understand objective vs. subjective moral theories and their implications
- Develop responses to secular ethical systems and moral relativism
- Learn to apply moral apologetics in contemporary cultural debates
- Demonstrate how biblical theism provides coherent foundation for ethics

## üîß The Moral Argument Structure

### Logical Formulation
```yaml
Classic Moral Argument:
  Premise 1: If God does not exist, objective moral values and duties do not exist
  Premise 2: Objective moral values and duties do exist
  Conclusion: Therefore, God exists

Alternative Formulations:
  C.S. Lewis Version:
    - Universal moral law exists
    - Moral law requires a moral lawgiver
    - This lawgiver is what we call God

  William Lane Craig Version:
    - Objective moral facts require grounding
    - Only God can adequately ground objective morality
    - Therefore, God's existence best explains moral reality
```

### Key Definitions and Distinctions
```yaml
Objective vs. Subjective Morality:
  Objective Moral Values:
    - Valid and binding regardless of belief
    - Discoverable, not invented
    - Universal in scope
    - Mind-independent reality

  Subjective Moral Views:
    - Dependent on individual or cultural opinion
    - Variable across persons and societies
    - Expressions of preference or sentiment
    - Mind-dependent constructions

Moral Values vs. Moral Duties:
  Moral Values:
    - Properties of things (good/bad, right/wrong)
    - Intrinsic worth or disvalue
    - Example: human dignity, justice, love

  Moral Duties:
    - Obligations and prohibitions
    - What we ought or ought not do
    - Commands and requirements
    - Example: prohibitions against murder, theft
```

## üé≠ Problems with Secular Ethics

### Evolutionary Ethics Failures
```yaml
Descriptive vs. Prescriptive Problem:
  Is-Ought Gap:
    - Evolution describes what is, not what ought to be
    - Natural selection doesn't create moral obligations
    - Survival value doesn't equal moral value
    - Naturalistic fallacy in evolutionary ethics

  Moral Epiphenomenalism:
    - Morality as evolutionary byproduct
    - No real moral knowledge possible
    - Debunking vs. vindicating genealogies
    - Undermines moral realism

Social Darwinism Problems:
  Historical Applications:
    - Justification for racism and eugenics
    - "Survival of fittest" applied to society
    - Elimination of "weak" and "unfit"
    - Logical extension of evolutionary ethics

  Contemporary Issues:
    - Abortion and infanticide arguments
    - Euthanasia and assisted suicide
    - Genetic engineering and enhancement
    - Social inequality justification
```

### Secular Moral Philosophy Inadequacies
```yaml
Utilitarianism Problems:
  Greatest Good Principle:
    - Difficulty in measuring and comparing goods
    - Tyranny of majority implications
    - Violation of individual rights
    - Counter-intuitive moral conclusions

  Practical Applications:
    - Sacrificing innocent for greater good
    - Utilitarian calculus complexity
    - Cultural bias in determining "good"
    - Lack of absolute moral prohibitions

Kantian Ethics Difficulties:
  Categorical Imperative:
    - Abstract and difficult to apply
    - Conflicts between duties
    - Lack of content for moral rules
    - Assumption of human dignity unexplained

  Practical Problems:
    - Duty-based ethics can justify evil
    - Universalizability test limitations
    - Autonomy as ultimate value questioned
    - No foundation for human worth
```

### Cultural Relativism Refutation
```yaml
Logical Problems:
  Self-Refutation:
    - Claim of relativism is itself absolute
    - Cannot critique any cultural practice
    - Makes moral progress impossible
    - Eliminates basis for human rights

  Practical Consequences:
    - Cannot condemn genocide or slavery
    - No basis for social reform
    - Tolerance becomes meaningless
    - Moral discourse becomes impossible

Cross-Cultural Moral Universals:
  Common Moral Intuitions:
    - Prohibition against unprovoked harm
    - Special obligations to family
    - Requirements of fairness and justice
    - Virtue of courage and compassion

  C.S. Lewis's "Tao":
    - Universal moral law across cultures

    - Evidence for objective moral reality
    - Points to common moral source

*The moral argument demonstrates that objective moral values and duties require a transcendent foundation, which is best explained by the existence of a perfectly good God. This argument not only provides evidence for theism but also shows the practical necessity of God for human flourishing and social justice.*
