# Reformed Theology - Comprehensive Framework & Distinctives

## üéØ Overview
Reformed theology represents the systematic biblical framework developed from the Protestant Reformation, emphasizing God's absolute sovereignty, Scripture's ultimate authority, and salvation by grace alone through faith alone.
