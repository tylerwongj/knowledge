## ðŸ“‚ Markdown File Plan

Each of these will be its own `.md` file to deep dive and annotate:

- `AI_Jobs_and_Automation.md`
- `Unity_Job_Roadmap.md`
- `LLM_Programming_Skills.md`
- `Soft_Skills_With_AI.md`
- `Resume_And_Coverletter_Tips.md`
- `Job_Sites_And_Search_Automation.md`
- `Prompt_Engineering_101.md`
- `LLM_Use_Cases_CheatSheet.md`
- `AI_Workflows_I_Use.md`
- `Personal_Brands_With_AI.md`
- `GPT_Scripts_And_Tools_List.md`
- `Quick_Wins_With_Automation.md`

---

## âœ… Immediate Next Steps

1. Prioritize 3 markdown files you want to dive into first.
2. Begin reviewing and highlighting important insights in those files.
3. Build a personal workspace (Notion, Obsidian, Git repo) to store + refine this knowledge.
4. Start applying small automations to your life or work to build portfolio proof.

## ðŸ§  Long-Term Practice Loop

- **Read + Highlight** â†’ Extract useful patterns
- **Build + Test** â†’ Apply what youâ€™ve learned in real workflows
- **Document + Share** â†’ Build a body of repeatable assets
- **Refine + Automate** â†’ Make yourself more efficient over time

---

## ðŸ’¡ Notes
- LLMs arenâ€™t just tools â€” theyâ€™re leverage.
- Quiet productivity gives you optionality: AI lets you perform better without needing to disclose how.
- If you can automate 80% of a task, you can focus on the 20% that requires judgment or creativity.
