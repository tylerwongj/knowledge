# Stock Sale & Tax Strategy Summary

---

## 1. Consult Financial Advisor / CPA
- Discuss your plan before selling.
- Understand tax implications (long-term vs. short-term gains).
- Plan timing and lot selection for tax efficiency.

---

## 2. Selling Stocks for $500K Down Payment
- Need to sell more than $500K gross to cover taxes and fees (~$600K - $650K estimate).
- Sell **high cost basis lots first** to minimize taxable gains.
- Prioritize shares held over 1 year to get long-term capital gains rates.
- Remember settlement (T+2) and wiring time (1 business day) — sell at least 3 days before funds needed.

---

## 3. Why Sell High Cost Basis Shares First?
- High cost basis = smaller gains = less taxable income.
- Example:  
  - Bought at $90, sell at $100 → $10 gain  
  - Bought at $30, sell at $100 → $70 gain  
- Lower taxes by selling shares with smaller gains.

## 4. How to Check Cost Basis on Schwab
- Use **Positions & Holdings** page.
- Look for **Lot Details** or **Cost Basis Details**.
- Export holdings to Excel/CSV and sort by cost basis.
- Contact Schwab support for help or reports if needed.

---

## 5. Timing of Sale: Early vs. Late
- Selling early:  
  - Cash ready, less stress, but risk missing market upside.
- Selling late (e.g., day 26 escrow):  
  - Keep money invested longer, risk of timing issues.
- Recommended: Sell early enough to allow settlement + wire time (3+ business days before funds needed).
- For large sales ($500K+), notify Schwab for smooth handling.

---

## 6. Capital Gains Tax & Income Impact
- Federal LTCG tax rates (long-term gains) depend on taxable income:  
  - 0% up to ~$90K (married filing jointly)  
  - 15% above that  
- CA taxes capital gains as ordinary income at 8-9% for most.
- If your family income is low (~$57.5K example), you can realize ~$30K long-term gains federally tax-free.
- Sell enough shares to realize those gains and maximize 0% bracket usage.
- CA state tax applies regardless.

---

## 7. Selling Losses (Tax-Loss Harvesting)
- Selling losing stocks offsets gains dollar-for-dollar.
- Excess losses reduce ordinary income up to $3,000 per year.
- Avoid wash sale rules (don't buy back same stock within 30 days).
- Use loss sales to reduce your net taxable gains further.

## 11. Final Confirmation & Nuance

- **Almost always sell high cost basis stocks first** to minimize taxable gains and tax bills.
- **Hold low cost basis stocks longer** due to high unrealized gains and potential for growth.
- **Donate low cost basis stocks to charity/church** to avoid capital gains taxes and get full deduction.
- **Sell losing stocks (tax-loss harvesting) strategically** to offset gains, but don’t feel forced to sell losses if you don’t have gains to offset.
- If you have no or low gains, selling losses only reduces ordinary income by up to $3,000/year, with the remainder carried forward.
- Balance selling losses and gains to maximize tax efficiency without disrupting your portfolio unnecessarily.
