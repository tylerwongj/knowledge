# Double Agent Game Concept — Summary & Next Steps

## Game Overview
A hidden-role social deduction game where most players are Bad Agents trying to identify and eliminate a secret Double Agent. The Double Agent tries to survive, gather power, and outwit the Bad Agents.

## Core Mechanics Discussed

### Simultaneous Action Selection
- Each player chooses and reveals one action card per round.
- Actions include: **Mine (gain power cards)**, **Vote to Attack**, and potentially others.
- Majority vote on "Vote to Attack" triggers an attack round.

### Attack Phase
- Players simultaneously point at a target.
- If majority targets the Double Agent → **War Phase triggered** instead of instant elimination.
- If majority targets a Bad Agent → Double Agent wins immediately.
- No majority → No elimination this round.

### War Phase
- Tactical showdown using collected Power Cards.
- Double Agent and Bad Agents use cards to attack, defend, and apply utility effects.
- Double Agent gains power multipliers based on game length (more rounds = bigger advantage).
- Victory depends on defeating opponents’ HP through card play.

### Power Card System
- Cards fall into categories: Attack, Defense, Utility, Healing, Multiplier.
- Examples: Flaming Sword (+2 attack), Iron Shield (blocks 2 damage), Spyglass (peek), Healing Potion (+HP), Double Edge (double damage, lose HP).
- Cards collected by mining from the central pile.
- Double Agent gains power cards at 1.5x rate.

## Possible Directions and Design Questions

### Game Focus
- Should the game be primarily a **deduction/bluffing game** or a **tactical card battle**?
- How much should the War Phase card battles impact the outcome versus social deduction?
- Should the War Phase be quick and simple, or deep and strategic?

### War Phase Mechanics
- What is the ideal length and complexity of the War Phase?
- How to balance HP, damage, and turn order based on game length?
- Should randomness (dice rolls or draws) be incorporated?

### Power Cards
- What specific card abilities encourage bluffing and deduction?
- Should some cards affect social mechanics (e.g., reveal votes, force discards)?
- How to limit or cap power card accumulation to avoid runaway advantage?

### Player Interaction
- How much communication or coordination should Bad Agents have?
- Should the Double Agent have unique bluffing tools?
- How to discourage early reckless attacks and encourage information gathering?

### Win Conditions & Balance
- What are fair victory thresholds for power accumulation and surviving rounds?
- How to ensure the Double Agent has a fighting chance even if discovered early?
- What penalties or risks discourage the Bad Agents from attacking too soon?

## Additional Ideas
- Event cards or rounds that shift game dynamics.
- Roles with special abilities or side objectives.
- Optional voting secrecy or multiple voting rounds.
- Mechanisms for misdirection like fake actions or hidden agendas.

## Next Steps
- Decide core game focus: Deduction-heavy vs. Card combat-heavy.
- Prototype simple War Phase with 3-5 Power Cards per player.
- Test balance on power multipliers and timing advantages.
- Brainstorm specific Power Card designs aligned with chosen focus.
- Define communication rules and bluffing mechanics.
