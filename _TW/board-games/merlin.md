# 🧩 Hidden-Role Card Game Concept

## 🎯 Objective

A social deduction card game where players secretly belong to different factions. The twist: one "base" exists in the center of the board, and players can either engage with each other or interact with the base.

The game ends when:
- A player dies, **or**
- The base is destroyed

At the end, players win or lose based on team alignment **and** whether key roles (like Merlin) are correctly identified.

## 🧙 Roles

### Merlin
- **Knows:** Possibly who the good player is — but **not** the Assassin or other roles.
- **Goal:** Protect the base (especially if it's good-aligned) and subtly guide teammates without being obvious.
- **If Merlin dies:** The Assassin gets one shot to guess who Merlin is. If guessed correctly, the Assassin wins.

### Assassin
- **Knows:** They are evil. Doesn't know who Merlin is.
- **Goal:** Kill Merlin or manipulate the game toward the base's destruction.
- **Twist:** If the Assassin dies, they guess who Merlin is. A correct guess grants an **evil team win**.

### Generic Good / Evil Roles
- **Good players** try to protect the base and each other.
- **Evil players** want chaos, base destruction, or to expose Merlin.

## 🏰 The Base

- Not strictly neutral.
- The **base may be aligned** (good, evil, or neutral) — but its nature is unknown at first.
- Players can interact with it instead of attacking others.
- **Mechanics ideas:**
  - Contributing to the base helps that team subtly.
  - Attacking the base weakens it — but doing so too obviously may reveal your alignment.

---

## 🃏 Gameplay Loop

1. One player begins and plays **one card** (attack, defend, interact).
2. Turns proceed clockwise; each player plays **one card per turn**.
3. Players may:
   - Attack another player
   - Defend themselves
   - Interact with the base (strengthen, sabotage, investigate, etc.)

---

## 🧠 Design Notes

- Avoid rewarding overly obvious behavior.
- Add risk to interacting with the base (e.g. weakening your own team unknowingly).
- Keep deduction and bluffing at the core of decision-making.
- Encourage multiple "legit" options each turn so players aren’t stuck.

---

## 💡 Additional Ideas

- **Secret Objectives:** Players may have hidden side goals (e.g., ensure the base has 3+ strength at end of game).
- **Event Cards:** Some cards change rules temporarily (fog of war, swap roles, reveal base alignment).
- **Multi-phase Game:** Add a “day/night” mechanic — maybe the base acts at night.
- **Hidden Deck Interaction:** Shuffle clues about the base’s alignment into the draw pile.

## 🔚 Victory Conditions

| Team   | How to Win |
|--------|------------|
| Good   | Keep Merlin alive, base survives, or evil is exposed |
| Evil   | Kill Merlin or destroy the base |
| Neutral (if applicable) | Fulfill personal win conditions |
